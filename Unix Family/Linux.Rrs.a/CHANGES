1.70: SSLv3/SSLv2 support, CRL, the -b and -0 options (May 29 2004)
    The -S option or --ssl=proto can be used to choose which encryption
    protocol supported by OpenSSL to use (TLSv1, SSLv3 and SSLv2 are
    supported). The -b option allows you to choose source port. rrs will bind
    to port X when connecting out, not the default kernel-assigned port.
    This'll be useful for bypassing fake-secure fw configs. The -0 option will
    simply do setuid(geteuid()) if rrs has been chmodded e.g. 4755/6755 (or
    setgid(getegid()) if it's only 2755). The -0 option is designed for
    offering a root shell from non-root accounts during pen-tests (i.e.
    sanctioned backdoor infiltrations). CRL support has been added and CRL
    files can be loaded with the -C option, the -C option (--ca or --crl) can
    now also be used to include an arbitrary amount of certificates to trust
    or CRL files of certificates not to trust. I have also included
    openssl_scripts for easily creating a root CA, subordinate CA(s) and
    client/server certificates. These scripts can be used for other purposes
    than rrs aswell.

1.41: Stand-alone encryption (Apr 13 2004)
    Added a simple symmetric per-byte XOR cipher. Although it's quite weak,
    it's useful to evade a NIDS and monitoring in general. The pass phrase is
    looped over the received/transmitted data, which makes it possible (if the
    data is structured in logic patterns) to extract the key from the data. To
    make this harder the pass phrase is computed to a combined SHA1+MD5 digest
    which is 72 bytes long. The SHA1 implementation is Copyright (C) 2000
    Peter Selinger (distributed under the GNU GPL).

    Added Twofish shared secret key (symmetric) encryption (implementation by
    The Cryptix Foundation Limited). The API (farm9crypt) and the Twofish
    implemenation was derived from cryptcat (by jojo@farm9.com). This allows
    you to use encryption if your box ain't got OpenSSL or you can't get rrs
    to compile against it. You can even compile a static rrs now (but without
    OpenSSL support).

    generateKey() in twofish2.cc creates *very* weak hashes! I've replaced
    generateKey() with a proper MD5 hasher (md5.c by L. Peter Deutsch).

1.33: Initial release (Apr 4 2004)
    First public release, complete with OpenSSL support.
