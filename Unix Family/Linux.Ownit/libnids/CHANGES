v1.17rc1 Aug 30 2002
- support for libnet-1.1 and --with-libnet=no
- added support for libpcap save files
- finally, DLT_LINUX_SLL is recognized
- removed a horrible assumption on sizeof(pointer); it could result in
  segfault in scan.c
- --enable-shared
- __i386 -> __i386__ || __i386 :(
- support for 802.1Q VLAN 
- support for wireless frames (DLT_IEEE802_11)
- got rid of (obsolete) pcap_open_live_new
- bail out if link type is unknown, instead of pretendind it is ethernet
- $(MAKE) -> $(MAKE) $(AM_MAKEFLAGS)
- added a working link to Ptacek-Newsham paper
- %hi -> %hu :)
- align IP header if necessary (should not be)
- improved libraries detection
- mentioned usefulness od setsockopt(...SO_RCVBUF...) on a fast network

v1.16 Nov 3 2000
- nah, at least a release forced by a security bug. A typo in libnids.c
could cause libnids to segfault when source routed frame has been received.

v1.15 Oct 9 2000
- token ring support
- new configurable option (non-default): if a tcp callback hasn't processed 
  all available data, it is called immediately again
- fixed alignment in hash.c, which caused sigsegv on Sparc
- another _obviously_ redundant include file added to configure test progs
- html version of the API documentation

v1.14 Jun 28 2000
- fixed memory leak in tcp.c (queued tcp segments used to be not freed
  after connection termination)
- added support to capture packets on all interfaces, including loopback
  (linux only, using new libpcap features - autoconf changed)
- added nids_register_udp(); if anyone cares for UDP checksums...
- stupid bug in nids_register_ip_frag() fixed
- removed comments from asm code in checksum.c; Solaris compiler didn't
  recognized them - sigh
- signed/unsigned bug in scan.c fixed
- tcp callback could be notified even if no nw data arrived - fixed
- added ability to disable tcp processing
- added ability to refrain from setting promisc flag
- libc5 support
- alpha platform support
- now it's possible to do setuid(nobody) after nids_init() with no loss
  of functionality (killtcp works)
- removed pcap_lookupnet() call - one can capture packets from an interface
  with no IP assigned
- hash function in tcp.c with pseudorandom parameters
- #define NIDS_MAJOR 1, #define NIDS_MINOR 14 in nids.h

v1.13 Jan 18 2000
- Changes by Dug Song:
  - GNU autoconf support
  - code cleanup and new libnids(3) manpage
  - disable portscan detection if scan_num_hosts == 0
  - new field in nids_params for pcap(3) support: pcap_filter
  - subtle bugfix in ip_check_ext()
  - Solaris support (endianness fixes, etc.)
- another tiny check in tcp.c 

v1.12 Sep 15 1999
- processing of ICMP Destination Unreachable 
- nids_next() and nids_getfd() functions added; new fields in nids_params:
  no_mem, ip_filter
- clean error reporting via nids_errbuf; used by nids_init(), nids_next(), 
  nids_getfd()
- some more samples

v1.11 Aug 20 1999
- some stupid bugs removed (hopefully no more segfaults)

v1.1 Aug 10 1999
- *BSD support added by Dug Song
- some minor cleanups in libnids.c
- changed the license to GPL

v1.0 July 30 1999 
- Initial public release
