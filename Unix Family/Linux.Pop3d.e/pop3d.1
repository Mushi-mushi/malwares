pop3d  \-\-  remote maildrop access server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B	/usr/sbin/in.pop3d [-h] [-d] [-i|-b] [-p portno]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Pop3d is a mailbox server based on the Internet Standard
STD 53,
Post Office Protocol Version 3. The program allows remote
access to UNIX maildrops found in \fB/var/spool/mail\fR. The
server requires user and password verification before a
maildrop can be opened. The server can retrieve and delete
messages from the maildrop on a per-message basis.
.P
The server runs in "inetd" mode by default or with the -i option
and it expects to be started by some server process such as inetd.
If the -b option is given, it is run as a standalone server in the
background (and should NOT be listed in inetd.conf).  The
standalone/background mode is somewhat faster and more efficient.
.P
The -h option prints usage and command line options.
.P
Pop3d listens for TCP requests on port 110 or on "portno" if the
-p portno option is given. Once connected
it expects single line commands terminated by a <CR-LF>.
.P
Pop3d currently supports the following POP3 commands; the
commands are case independent.
