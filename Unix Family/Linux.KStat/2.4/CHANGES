New Features in v.1.1 for 2.4.x kernels

* sys_call lookup via IDT [*]

system_call() handler function checking via IDT
system_call() handler function address restore
sys_call_table extraction via system_call()

all checks and operations on sys_calls now take
count of the possible legal symbol / IDT mismatch

* process lookup via pidhash table [*]

this should protect a little better against processes
whose PCB has been unlinked from the doubly linked
list of tasks task_struct. this also reflects into
looking for active sockets.

[*] I know this patches are LATE =) The problem is
    I do NOT have time right now to stay in touch
    with all chess openings :O BTW I do NOT consider
    kstat being able to protect against every ad-hoc 
    kernel patch. kstat should warn when script kids
    run kernel codes. I think the real problem in
    the kernel patches/anti-kernel patches war is
    the SEMPER's epoch in AD MAIORA SEMPER :P ...
