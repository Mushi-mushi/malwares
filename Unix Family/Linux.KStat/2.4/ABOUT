This is a major update of kstat, since its release for the
2.2.x kernels. This runs on 2.4.x only, and can better assist
in finding and removing troyan LKMs. It sports network
socket dumps, sys_call fingerprinting, stealth modules
scanning and more. This is not a 'signature-tool'. This
requires a bit of expertise and knowledge of what is going
on.
