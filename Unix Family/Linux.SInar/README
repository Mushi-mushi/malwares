Blah Blah Blah.

Above and beyond anything else I can tell you, read the source files, there are some comments in that which aren't sarcastic. 
(not many mind you).

This is provided for Educational use only. Don't put it into a live environment, the code may not be stable (or something),
see the LICENSE file for the copyright notice etc etc..

If you want to add the x86 patching code do so and let me know so i can stick you on a CONTRIBUTORS list.
As one alternative, don't tell me and I won't.

Read the Makefile in src/ then change as appropriate for your architecture, 
probably best not to try changing for the m68k however...Maybe I should start a "PORTS" tree.

You can change the key for execve easily. To use it, you will probably want a file with the key string in it.
I would suggest symlinks. Maybe to something like, oh i can't possibly imagine.. /bin/bash maybe?
(there are lots of uses for being able to run something as root without it being in ps.. I would think.)

If you have any sense (ie you don't like reading system logs when you know what they are), 
you may not want cmn_err generating log entries, so comment them out.
(thought I would leave you something to do).

But as this will only be used for educational purposes, it doesn't matter.

Does it.
