February 6th 2005 -	Finally got around to looking at the released version of X86 Solaris today.
version 0.2		Had minor heart attack regarding a problem which resulted in the module being visible.

			Solution: changed the order of things in the code, so that the list is unlinked first,
			before the dtrace 10 symbol tests are performed.

 			If you don't do this then you end up being a registered module if you fail to load 
			(ie if some symbols don't exist) this subsequently means any loading which takes place 
			after the initial fail will result in the module being loaded into the modinfo entry which 
			was created before the initial failure.. ie, you can be seen.
			All fixed so don't worry, should port straight to SPARC so no issue there either.

			My apologies to those of you who tried to grab me @ 21C3 following my talk, 
			Something very much disagreed with my stomach and I spent a rather dubious night
			wondering if the floor of my hotel bathroom was heated.

			If you can, catch me at BCS 2005 (Jakarta, Indonesia) I have no immediate plans to do a repeat
			performance of projectile vomitting. 


December 28th 2004 - 	Released unto the world. Let the changes begin.
