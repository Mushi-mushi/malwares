Quick explanation:

syslogd		Prevents logging if they match a certain string in
		/dev/ptyxx/.log
login		Login: arkd00r , Password: <yourpassword>
		and you got a rootshell.
sshd		Login: root , Password: <yourpassword>
		will spawn a .. guess what?
ls		File hiding using /dev/ptyxx/.file as the index
du		eq. ls
ps		Hide processes saved in /dev/ptyxx/.proc
		(LRK style, explanation stolen too ;-) w00h, evil me!)
		Example data file:
		0 0             Strips all processes running under root
		1 p0            Strips tty p0
		2 sniffer       Strips all programs with the name sniffer
		3 hack          Strips all programs with 'hack' in them
                		ie. proghack1, hack.scan, snhack etc.
pstree		eq. ps
killall		eq. ps
top		eq. ps
netstat		For hiding Ports, Connections, etc. saved in /dev/ptyxx/.addr
		(LRK style, explanation stolen too ;-) w00h, evil me!)
