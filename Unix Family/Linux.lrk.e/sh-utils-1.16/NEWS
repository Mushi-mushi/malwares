Changes in release 1.16

Changes in release 1.15
* nice works with very recently-changed GNU libc getopt

Changes in release 1.14
* fix bug in getdate.y that broke date's --date=DATE option on systems
  like SunOS4.
* expr treats unadorned ? and + as literals.  To make expr treat them as
  operators you have to use \? and \+.

Changes in release 1.13
* two patches for ISC
* Regenerate all Makefile.in using a patched version of automake-1.1l.
 [1.12s]
* lots of little bug fixes -- see ChangeLog
 [1.12r]
* uname --processor (-p) works on systems that have sysinfo and define
  SI_ARCHITECTURE.
* stty works better on systems like i386-pc-isc3.0
* date --date=DATE accepts dates like those in an RCS log listing, e.g.,
  `1992/11/01 05:44:34'.
* printf now warns if excess arguments are ignored.
* tee no longer fails immediately upon receipt of SIGPIPE
 [1.12q]
* running `make check' runs tests of nice
* lots of configuration-related improvements
* nice allows `+' in options like -+8 and -+13.
* when matching, expr warns about non-portability when the first character
  of the basic regular expression is `^'
* `id user' no longer prints bogus group list
* uses automake-generated Makefile templates
* date accepts new %V format
* date's %U and %W formats work properly
* nice option handling works with 2-digit old-style-option adjustments.
  Now, `nice -18 -- nice' prints `18'.  Before it printed `8'.
* internationalized diagnostic messages
* `date -d "01/01/1998 3 years" +%Y' now works properly.  It prints 2001.
* New programs: chroot, factor, seq, uptime.
* date accepts new option: --rfc-822 (-R)
* date accepts new format, %z, for RFC-822 style numeric timezone (-0500)
* date: fix bugs in the handling of date -u +'%s %Z'.
* date accepts new option --reference=FILE (-r FILE) analogous to the
  like-named touch option.

User visible changes in release 1.12
* None.
User visible changes in release 1.11
* date accepts new option: (-f) --file=DATEFILE
* skeletal texinfo documentation (mainly just the `invoking' nodes)
* `stty werase ^W' works.  Before, werase wasn't enabled for AIX-3.2.5.
* su with no arguments works properly
* nice accepts options like `--5' (this is interpreted like `-n -5')
* nice now interprets `-1 -1' like `-1' not like `-11'
* `stty speed' and `stty size' no longer output a spurious newline
User visible changes in release 1.10
* change package name from shellutils to sh-utils
* add hostname, pwd, and users commands
* --version outputs the name of the utility as well as the package name
  and version number.
* Configure properly determines options for stty on SCO ODT 3.0 systems.
* `date -d' works better.  Before, `date -d '4apr94'' produced
  `Sun Apr  3 23:00:00 CDT 1994'.
User visible changes in release 1.9.4
* Repair stty option handling.
User visible changes in release 1.9.3
* `stty -a -g' gets a diagnostic
* `stty {-a|-g} any-other-argument' gets a diagnostic
* stty no longer ignores some of its arguments
* basename and dirname no longer treat `--' specially
* `basename -- file.c .c' generates a usage error.  Before, it output `file'.
* `basename file-dist -dist' outputs `file'.  Before it output `file-dist'.
* stty defaults `swtch' to undefined for Solaris so `susp' (^Z) will work.
  Before, with the default settings ^Z did nothing.
* stty no longer gives an error message when it finds a spurious difference
  (due to buggy tcgetattr/tcsetattr) between requested and current tty
  modes under SunOS 4.1.x.
* stty no longer fails if the ioctl to determine the display width fails
  when displaying settings.
* stty works around SunOS 4.x kernel bug that made `stty rows 0 cols 0' fail.
* who and tee no longer fail gratuitously when continued after an
  interrupted read or write system call.
* date accepts new format: %s time in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UCT
* date -d can parse dates like `11-JUL-1991'
* expr '' == 0 works (before, it printed 1)
* stty no longer fails on telnet sessions to Solaris systems
* `cd /etc; who utmp' now works.  Before, any filename argument had to be
  absolute or relative to /dev.

User visible changes in release 1.9.2:
* who output is better formatted on Solaris and other SysVr4 systems
* fix a minor problem in formatting the output from `stty -a'
* yes with arguments outputs newlines again
* partial stty failures are reported

Major changes in release 1.9.1:
* stty can be built on Suns again
* minor fix for who -q

Major changes in release 1.9:
* su fails gracefully when getpass is unable to open /dev/tty.
* printenv and tty detect and report write errors
* fix bug in stty
* stty accepts the new options status and flush on systems that provide them
* `expr 1 / 0' gives an error message rather than trying to divide by zero
* expr's `substr' doesn't overrun malloc'd buffer
* expr recognizes the string `0' as zero
* better support for Linux, Dec Alpha, and SGI Irix
* all programs (even true and false) accept --version and --help options
* uname's --version option is no longer equivalent to its -v option
* configure uses config.h, so DEFS won't exceed preprocessor limits of
  some compilers on the number of symbols defined via -D.
* work around problem where $(srcdir)/config.h was used instead of
  ../config.h -- this happened only when building in a subdirectory
  and when config.h remained in $(srcdir) from a previous ./configure.
* make may be run from the subdirectories

Major changes in release 1.8:
* add echo command
* fix some incorrect warnings in pathchk
* look at the right utmp file on 386BSD
* date doesn't dump core on some systems now
