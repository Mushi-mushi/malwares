.SH SYNOPSIS

.B pwd
{\-\-help,\-\-version}
.SH DESCRIPTION
This documentation is no longer being maintained and may be inaccurate
or incomplete.  The Texinfo documentation is now the authoritative source.
.PP
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.BR pwd .
.B pwd
prints the fully resolved name of the current directory.
That is, all components of the printed name will be actual
directory names \-\- none will be symbolic links.
.PP
Note that most Unix shells provide a built-in
.B pwd
command with similar functionality so the unadorned, interactive
.B pwd
command will usually execute the built-in version and not this one.
