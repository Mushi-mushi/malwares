.SH SYNOPSIS
.B true

.B true
{\-\-help,\-\-version}
.SH DESCRIPTION
This documentation is no longer being maintained and may be inaccurate
or incomplete.  The Texinfo documentation is now the authoritative source.
.PP
This manual page
documents the GNU version of
.B true
(and probably every other version, as well).
.B true
does nothing except return an exit status of 0, meaning ``success''.
It can be used as a place holder in shell scripts where a successful
command is needed, although the shell built-in command `:' (colon)
does the same thing faster.
.SS OPTIONS
When GNU
.B true
is invoked with exactly one argument, the following options are recognized:
.TP
.I "\-\-help"
Print a usage message on standard output and exit successfully.
.TP
.I "\-\-version"
Print version information on standard output then exit successfully.
