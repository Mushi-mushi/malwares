This is a package of small shell programming utilities.  They are mostly
compliant with POSIX.2, where applicable.

The programs that can be built with this package are:

  basename chroot date dirname echo env expr factor false groups
  hostname id logname nice nohup pathchk printenv printf pwd seq
  sleep stty su tee test true tty uname users who whoami yes

Some programs (chroot, nice, nohup, uname, and stty) are built and
installed only on systems that have the features to support them.
su is always built, but it is installed only if the installer can
create setuid-root programs.

If you want to install the su program separately, you can run
`./configure && make check && make install' as usual;  that will
install all programs except su if you installed as a non-privileged
user.  Then run `make install-root' as root to install only su.

See the file NEWS for a list of major changes in the current release.

See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.

If you are using a version of the Linux libc that predates 4.4.1,
you should get a newer version.  The old libraries contain getopt
functions that are incompatible with certain uses of the date program.
For instance, when built with the obsolete getopt functions, `date +%j'
will give a usage error instead of the expected result.

nice, stty, and uname require facilities not available on all systems;
`configure' detects this and does not try to compile them on systems
where those facilities are missing.
nohup requires nice.
su will be installed only if you do `make install' as root.

Many thanks to all of the people who have taken the time to submit
problem reports and fixes.  Contributed changes are attributed in the
ChangeLog file.

Note that the distributed man pages are no longer being updated.
The authoritative documentation is in texinfo form in the doc directory.

These programs all recognize the `--version' option.  When reporting
bugs, please include in the subject line both the package name/version
and the name of the program for which you found a problem.

For general documentation on the coding and usage standards
this distribution follows, see the GNU standards document
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/standards.*, especially the `Makefile
Conventions', `Configuration', and `User Interfaces' sections.
