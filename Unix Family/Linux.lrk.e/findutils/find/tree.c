/* Optimize the ordering of the predicates in the tree.  Rearrange
   them to minimize work.  Strategies:
   * Evaluate predicates that don't need inode information first;
     the predicates are divided into 1 or more groups separated by
     predicates (if any) which have "side effects", such as printing.
     The grouping implements the partial ordering on predicates which
     those with side effects impose.
   * Place -name, -path, and -regex at the front of a group, with
     -name and -path ahead of -regex.  Predicates that are moved to the
     front of a group by definition do not have side effects.

     This routine "normalizes" the predicate tree by ensuring that
     all expression predicates have AND (or OR or COMMA) parent nodes
     which are linked along the left edge of the expression tree.
     This makes manipulation of subtrees easier.
