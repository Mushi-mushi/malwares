.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Scp2
(Secure Copy) is used in copying files over the network securely.
It uses
.B ssh2
for data transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides
the same security as
.B ssh2 ".
Unlike
.BR rcp ",
.B scp2
will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are needed for
authentication.
.LP
Any filename may contain a host, user and port specification to
indicate that the file is to be copied to/from that host.  Copies
between two remote hosts are permitted. ``file'' can contain wildcards
``*'' and ``?'', in which case they are expanded by scp2. These
wildcards can be escaped by a ``\\'', in which case the wildcard is
not expanded.

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-D \ debug_level_spec\fR\c
Print extensive debug information to stderr. debug_level_spec is
a number, from 0 to 99, where 99 specifies that all debug
information should be displayed.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-d \c
With this option,
.B scp2
will make sure that the destination file is a directory. If not,
.B scp2
will exit with an error message.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-p \c
Tells
.B scp2
to preserve file attributes and timestamps.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-n \c
Makes
.B scp2
show what operations would've been done, without actually copying
any files.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-u \c
Makes
.B scp2
remove source-files after copying.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-v \c
Makes
.B scp2
verbose. This is equal to specifying `-D 2'-option.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-h \c
Display short help.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-c \ cipher\fR\c
Select encryption algorithm, that 
.B ssh2
will use. Multiple -c options are allowed and
a single -c flag can have only one cipher. 
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-S \ ssh2-path\fR\c
Specifies the path to
.B ssh2
used in connecting.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-P \ ssh2-port\fR\c
Specifies the remote port to
.B ssh2 ".
Ports can also be defined in a file-to-file basis. See 
.B SYNOPSIS ".
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-t \fRor\fB \-f \c
These options are reserved for
.B scp1
compatibility mode. If they are used with
.B scp2\fR,
it gives them as arguments to
.B scp1
to handle the connection.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-1\c
This option invokes
.B scp1
with given arguments. The
.B ``-1''
is removed from the list, however, because scp1 doesn't understand
this option. Because of this, it is wise to give this option as the
first argument to
.B scp2
and separated from other arguments. Otherwise, it probably won't work.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-r\c
This option specifies, that 
.B scp2
should copy directories recursively. Does not follow symbolic links.

.SH INSTALLATION
.LP
.B Scp2 
uses 
.B ssh2
in network connections.  Therefore it is not installed suid-root.
Notice that subsystem `sftp-server' must be defined in 
.BR sshd2 (8)'s
configuration file in the remote end for 
.B scp2 
to work.
