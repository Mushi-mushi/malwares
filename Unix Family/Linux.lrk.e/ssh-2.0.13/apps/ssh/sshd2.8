.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B Sshd2 
(Secure Shell Daemon) is the daemon program for 
.BR ssh2 ".
Together these programs replace rlogin and rsh programs, and
provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts
over an insecure network.  The programs are intended to be as easy to
install and use as possible.
.LP
.B Sshd2 
is normally started at boot from 
.I /etc/rc.local
or equivalent.  It forks a new
daemon for each incoming connection.  The forked daemons handle
key exchange, encryption, authentication, command execution,
and data exchange.
.LP
.B Sshd2 
can be configured using command-line options or a configuration
file.  Command-line options override values specified in the
configuration file.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d \ debug_level_spec
Debug mode.  The server sends verbose debug output to stderr.
This option is only intended for debugging for the server.  The
debugging level is either a number, or a comma-separated list of
assignments "ModulePattern=debug_level".
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-f \ configuration_file
Specifies the name of the configuration file.  The default is
.IR /etc/ssh2/sshd2_config ".
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-h \ host_key_file
Specifies the file from which the host key is read (default
.IR /etc/ssh2/hostkey).  
If sshd2 is not run as root, the default host key file will be
.IR $HOME$/.ssh2/hostkey.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-o \ 'option'
Can be used to give options in the format used in the
configuration files.  This is useful for specifying options for
which there is no separate command-line flag.  The option has the
same format as a line in the configuration file.  Comment lines
are not currently accepted.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-p \ port
Specifies the port on which the server listens for connections
(default is 22).
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-v
Enable verbose mode. Display verbose debugging messages. Equal to
`-d 2'. This option can also be specified in the configuration file.
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-q
Quiet mode.  Nothing is sent to the system log.  Normally the
beginning, authentication, and termination of each connection is
logged. This option can also be specified in the configuration
file. 
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-g \ login_grace_time
Gives the grace time for clients to authenticate themselves (default
600 seconds).  If the client fails to authenticate the user within
this many seconds, the server disconnects and exits.  A value of zero
indicates no limit. (not yet implemented)
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-i
Specifies that sshd is being run from inetd.
.ne 3
.TP

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE

.B Sshd2
reads configuration data from 
.I /etc/ssh2/sshd2_config
(or the file specified with -f on the command line).  The file
contains keyword-value pairs, one per line.  Lines starting with \'#\'
and empty lines are interpreted as comments.

The following keywords are possible. Keywords are case insensitive. 
.TP
.de YN
"\fByes\fR" or "\fBno\fR".
..

.TP
.B AllowedAuthentications
This keyword specifies the authentications methods, that are allowed
to use. This is comma-separated list consisting of (currently) words
.IR password,
.I publickey 
and
.IR hostbased .
Each specifies an authentication method. Default is
"\fIpassword,publickey\fR". With
.BR RequiredAuthentications ,
sysadmin can force users to complete several authentications before
they are considered authenticated.
.ne 3

.TP
.B AllowHosts
This keyword can be followed by any number of host name patterns,
separated by spaces.  If specified, login is allowed only from hosts
whose name matches one of the patterns.  \'*\' and \'?\' can be used as
wildcards in the patterns.  Normal name servers are used to map the
client's host into a canonical host name.  If the name cannot be
mapped, its IP-address is used as the host name.  By default all hosts
are allowed to connect.

Note that
.B sshd2
can also be configured to use tcp_wrappers using the --with-libwrap
compile-time configuration option.
.ne 3

.TP
.B AllowSHosts
This keyword can be followed by any number of host name patterns,
separated by spaces. If specified, .shosts (and .rhosts,
/etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/shosts.equiv) entries are only honoured for
hosts whose name matches one of the patterns.
'*' and '?' can be used as wildcards in the patterns.  Normal name
servers are used to map the client's host into a canonical host name.
If the name cannot be mapped, its IP-address is used as the host name.
By default all hosts are allowed to connect.
.ne 3

.TP 
.B AuthorizationFile
Specifies the name of the user's authorization file.
.ne 3

.TP
.B CheckMail
Specifies whether
.B sshd
should print information whether you have new mail or not when a user
logs in interactively.  (On some systems it is also printed by the
shell, /etc/profile, or equivalent.)  The argument must be
.YN
The default is
"yes".
.ne 3

.TP
.B Ciphers
Specifies the ciphers to use for encrypting the
session. Currently, 
.\" XXX Could this be made dist-dependent ?
.IR des ",
.IR 3des ",
.IR blowfish ", 
.IR idea
and 
.IR arcfour
and
.IR twofish
are supported, of which
.IR des ",
.IR 3des ",
.IR arcfour ",
.IR blowfish
and
.IR twofish
are in all distributions. Multiple ciphers can be specified as a
comma-separated list.  Special values to this option are
.IR any ",
.IR anystd ",
that allows only standard (see below) ciphers, and
.IR anycipher
that allows either any available cipher or excludes nonencrypting
cipher mode
.IR none
but allows all others.
.IR anystdcipher
is the same as above, but includes only those ciphers mentioned in the
IETF-SecSH-draft (excluding 'none').
.ne 3

.TP
.B DenyHosts
This keyword can be followed by any number of host name patterns,
separated by spaces.  If specified, login is disallowed from the hosts
whose name matches any of the patterns.
.ne 3

.TP
.B DenySHosts
This keyword can be followed by any number of host name patterns,
separated by spaces. If specified, .shosts (and .rhosts,
/etc/hosts.equiv and /etc/shosts.equiv) entries whose name matches any
of the patterns are ignored.
.ne 3

.TP
.B ForcePTTYAllocation
.\" What does the server do with this?
For tty allocation, ie. allocate a tty even if a command is
given. The argument must be
.YN
(not yet implemented)
.ne 3

.TP
.B ForwardAgent
Specifies whether the connection to the authentication agent (if any)
will be forwarded to the remote machine. The argument must be
.YN
.ne 3

.TP
.B ForwardX11
Specifies whether X11 connections will be automatically
redirected over the secure channel and DISPLAY set. The argument
must be
.YN
.ne 3

.TP
.B HostKeyFile
Specifies the file containing the private host key (default
.IR /etc/ssh2/hostkey ").
.ne 3

.TP
.B IgnoreRhosts
Specifies that rhosts and shosts files will not be used in
"hostbased"-authentication (see
.BR AllowedAuthentications ).
.I /etc/hosts.equiv
and
.I /etc/shosts.equiv 
are still used. The argument must be
.YN
The default is "no".
.ne 3

.TP
.B KeepAlive
Specifies whether the system should send keepalive messages to
the other side.  If they are sent, death of the connection or
crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  However,
this means that connections will die if the route is down
temporarily, and some people find it annoying. On the other hand,
if keepalives are not send, sessions may hang indefinitely on the
server, leaving "ghost" users and consuming server resources.

The default is "\fByes\fR" (to send keepalives), and the server
will notice if the network goes down or the client host reboots.
This avoids infinitely hanging sessions.

To disable keepalives, the value should be set to "\fBno\fR" in
both the server and the client configuration files.
.ne 3

.TP
.B ListenAddress
Specifies the ip address of the interface where the
.B sshd2 
server socket is bind.
.ne 3

.TP
.B LoginGraceTime
The server disconnects after this time if the user has not
successfully logged in.  If the value is 0, there is no time limit.
The default is 600 (seconds). (not yet implemented)
.ne 3

.TP
.B MaxConnections
Specifies the maximum number of connections
.B sshd2
will handle simultaneously. This is useful in systems where spamming
.B sshd2
with new connections can cause the system to become unstable or
crash. The argument is a positive number. 0 means that number of
connections is unlimited (by
.BR sshd2 ).

Note that by using (at least) xinetd you achieve the same effect.
.ne 3

.TP
.B NoDelay
If "\fByes\fR", enable socket option TCP_NODELAY. The argument must be
.YN
Default is "\fBno\R".
.ne 3

.TP
.B PasswordAuthentication
Specifies whether to use password authentication. The argument
must be
.YN
.B Note:
This keyword is deprecated. Use
.B AllowedAuthentications
and
.BR RequiredAuthentications .
.ne 3

.TP
.B PasswordGuesses
Specifies the number of tries that the user has when using
password authentication. The default is 3.
.ne 3

.TP
.B PermitEmptyPasswords
When password authentication is allowed, it specifies whether the
server allows login to accounts with empty password strings. The
argument must be
.YN (not yet implemented)
.ne 3

.TP
.B PermitRootLogin
Specifies whether the root can log in using
.BR ssh2 .
May be set to "\fByes\fR", "\fBnopwd\fR", or "\fBno\fR".  The default
is "\fByes\fR", allowing root logins through any of the authentication
types allowed for other users.  The "\fBnopwd\fR" value disables
password-authenticated root logins.  The "\fBno\fR" value disables
root logins through any of the authentication methods. ("\fBnopwd\fR"
and "\fBno\fR" are equivalent unless you have a .rhosts or .shosts in
the root home directory and you you haven't set up public key
authentication for root.)

Root login with public key authentication when the "\fBcommand\fR"
option has been specified will be allowed regardless of the value of
this setting (which may be useful for taking remote backups even if
root login is normally not allowed).  The default is "\fByes\fR".The
argument must be
.YN
.ne 3

.TP
.B Port
Specifies the port number that
.B sshd2
listens on.  The current default is 22.
.ne 3

.TP
.B PrintMotd
Specifies whether
.B sshd2
should print 
.I /etc/motd
when a user logs in interactively. The default
is "\fByes\fR".  The argument must be
.YN
.ne 3

.TP
.B PubKeyAuthentication
Specifies whether to try public key authentication.
.B RSAAuthentication
is a synonym for this keyword, and it is defined for backwards
compatibility with
.B ssh1\fR.
The argument must be
.YN  
.B Note:
This keyword is deprecated. Use
.B AllowedAuthentications
and
.BR RequiredAuthentications .
.ne 3

.TP
.B PublicHostKeyFile
Specifies the file containing the public host key (default
.IR /etc/ssh2/hostkey.pub ").
Note: In most cases the order of config parameters isn't an
issue. Here it is safe if you specify HostKeyFile first before
this parameter.
.ne 3

.TP
.B RandomSeedFile
Specifies the name of the randomseed file.
.ne 3

.TP
.B RequiredAuthentications
Related to
.BR AllowedAuthentications ,
this is used to specify what authentication methods the users
.I must
complete before continuing. This parameter has no default.
.B Note:
This parameter has to be a subset for 
.BR AllowedAuthentications .
Otherwise, the server denies connection everytime.
.ne 3

.TP
.B QuietMode
Specifies whether the system runs in quiet mode.  In quiet mode,
nothing is logged in the system log, except fatal errors.  The
argument must be
.YN
.ne 3

.TP
.B Ssh1Compatibility
Specifies whether to use SSH1 compatibility code. With this option,
.B sshd1
is executed when the client supports only SSH 1.x protocols. The argument
must be
.YN
.ne 3

.TP
.B Sshd1Path
Specifies the path to 
.B sshd1 
daemon, which is executed if the
client supports only SSH 1.x protocols. The arguments for 
.B sshd2 
are passed on to 
.B sshd1 ".
.ne 3

.TP
.B StrictModes
Specifies whether 
.B sshd2 
should check file modes and ownership of the user's home directory and
rhosts files before accepting login.  This is normally desirable because
novices sometimes accidentally leave their directory or files
world-writable.  The argument must be
.YN 
The default is "\fByes\fR". (not yet implemented)
.ne 3

.TP
.B SyslogFacility
Gives the facility code that is used when logging messages from
.B sshd2.
The possible values are: DAEMON, USER, AUTH, LOCAL0, LOCAL1, LOCAL2,
LOCAL3, LOCAL4, LOCAL5, LOCAL6, LOCAL7.  The default is AUTH.
.ne 3

.TP
.B UserConfigDirectory
Specifies where user-specific configuration data should be fetched
from. With this the administration can control whatever configuration
parameters they wish that are normally the users' domain. This is
given as a pattern string, which is expanded by sshd2. %D is the
user's home directory, %U is user's login name, %IU is the user's user
ID (uid) and %IG is his group ID (gid). The default is 
.I %D/.ssh2

.TP
.B UserKnownHosts
Specifies whether user's \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh2/knownhosts/ -directory can be used to fetch hosts public keys when
using "\fBhostbased\fR"-authentication.
The argument must be
.YN
The default is "yes".
.ne 3

.TP
.B VerboseMode
Verbose mode.  Causes 
.B sshd2 
to print debugging messages about its
progress. This is helpful in debugging connection,
authentication, and configuration problems.
.ne 3

.SH LOGIN PROCESS

When a user successfully logs in,
.B sshd2
does the following:
.IP 1.
Changes to run with normal user privileges.
.IP 2.
Sets up basic environment.
.IP 3.
Reads /etc/environment if it exists.
.IP 4.
Changes to user's home directory.
.IP 5.
Runs user's shell or command.
.RT

.SH SSH WITH TCP WRAPPERS

When 
.B sshd2
is compiled with tcp wrappers libraries, then the
host.allow/deny files also controls who can connect to ports forwarded
by 
.BR sshd2 .

The program names in the hosts.allow/deny files are
.B sshd2
or
.B sshd
(depending on how you execute you 
.BR sshd2 ),
.B sshdfwd-\c
.I <portname>\c
,
.B sshdfwd-\c
.I <portnumber>\c
, and
.B sshdfwd-X11
for forwarded ports the ssh client or server is listening.
.LP
If the port has name defined then you must use it. 

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/sshd2_config
Contains configuration data for
.BR sshd2 .  
This file should be writable by root only, but it is recommended
(though not necessary) that it be world-readable.
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/hostkey
Contains the private part of the host key.  This file is normally
created automatically by "make install", but can also be created
manually using
.BR ssh-keygen2 (1).
This file should only be owned by root, readable only by root, and not
accessible to others.
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/hostkey.pub
Contains the public part of the host key.  This file is normally
created automatically by "make install", but can also be created
manually.  This file should be world-readable but writable only by
root.  Its contents should match the private part.  
.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/random_seed
This file contains a seed for the random number generator.  This file
should only be accessible by root.
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh2/authorization
contains information on how the server will verify the identity of
an user. See 
.BR ssh2 (1)
for more information.
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0hushlogin
If this file exists, 
.B sshd2 
will not print information during login. (This is normally user's last
login time, message of the day and mailcheck.)

.TP
.I /etc/nologin
If this file exists, 
.B sshd2
refuses to let anyone except root log in.  The contents of the file
are displayed to anyone trying to log in, and non-root connections are
refused.  The file should be world-readable.

.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0rhosts
This file contains host-username pairs, separated by a space, one per
line.  The given user on the corresponding host is permitted to log in
without password.  The same file is used by rlogind and rshd.
.B sshd2 
differs from rlogind and rshd in that it requires public host key
authentication in addition to validating the host name retrieved from
domain name servers . The file must be writable only by the user; it
is recommended that it not be accessible by others.

It is also possible to use netgroups in the file.  Either host or user
name may be of the form +@groupname to specify all hosts or all users
in the group.
.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0shosts
For
.B ssh2,
this file is exactly the same as for \s+2.\s0rhosts.  However, this file is
not used by rlogin and rshd, so using this permits access using
.B ssh2
only.
.TP
.I /etc/hosts.equiv
This file is used during \s+2.\s0rhosts authentication.  In the
simplest form, this file contains host names, one per line.  Users on
those hosts are permitted to log in without a password, provided they
have the same user name on both machines.  The host name may also be
followed by a user name; such users are permitted to log in as
.B any
user on this machine (except root).  Additionally, the syntax +@group
can be used to specify netgroups.  Negated entries start with \'-\'.

If the client host/user is successfully matched in this file, login is
automatically permitted provided the client and server user names are the
same.  Additionally, successful RSA host authentication is normally
required.  This file must be writable only by root; it is recommended
that it be world-readable.

\fBWarning: It is almost never a good idea to use user names in 
hosts.equiv.\fR
Beware that it really means that the named user(s) can log in as
\fBanybody\fR,
which includes bin, daemon, adm, and other accounts that own critical
binaries and directories.  Using a user name practically grants the
user root access.  The only valid use for user names that I can think
of is in negative entries.
\fBNote that this warning also applies to rsh/rlogin.\fR
.TP
.I /etc/shosts.equiv
This is processed exactly as
.I /etc/hosts.equiv.
However, this file may be useful in environments that want to run both
rsh/rlogin and
.B ssh2.

.TP
.I \&$HOME/\s+2.\s0ssh2/knownhosts/xxxxyyyy.pub
These are the public hostkeys of hosts that a user wants to log from
using "\fBhostbased\fR"-authentication (equivalent with ssh1's
\fBRhostsRSAAuthentication\fR). Also, a user has to set up her/his
\fI$HOME/.shosts\fR (which only ssh uses) or \fI$HOME/.rhosts\fR file
(insecure, as it is used by the r*-commands also). If username is the
same in both hosts, it is adequate to put the public hostkey to
\fI/etc/ssh2/knownhosts\fR and add the host's name to
\fI/etc/shosts.equiv\fR (or \fI/etc/hosts.equiv\fR).

xxxx denotes the hostname (FQDN) and yyyy the publickey
algorithm of the key.

For example, zappa.foo.fi's hostkey algorithm is ssh-dss. The hostkey
would be named "\fIzappa.foo.fi.ssh-dss.pub\fR" in the
knowhosts-directory.

Possible names for publickey-algorithms are "\fBssh-dss\fR" and
"\fBssh-rsa\fR" (without the quotes).

.TP
.I /etc/ssh2/knownhosts/xxxxyyyy.pub
As above, but system-wide. These can be overridden by the user by
putting a file with the same name to her/his
\fI$HOME/.ssh2/knownhosts\fR directory.


.SH INSTALLATION
.LP
.B Sshd2 
is normally run as root.  If it is not run as root, it can
only log in as the user it is running as, and password authentication
may not work if the system uses shadow passwords.  An alternative
host key file must also be used.
