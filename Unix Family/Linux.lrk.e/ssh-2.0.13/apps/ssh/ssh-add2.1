.SH DESCRIPTION 
.LP
.B ssh-add2
adds identities to the authentication agent,
.B ssh-agent2.
If any file requires a passphrase,
.B ssh-add2
asks for the passphrase from the user.  If the -p option is given then
the passphrase is read from stdin, otherwise if the user is using X11,
the passphrase is requested using a small X11 program; otherwise it is
read from the user's tty.  (Note: it may be necessary to redirect stdin
from /dev/null to get the passphrase requested using X11.)
.LP
The authentication agent must be running and must be an ancestor of
the current process for
.B ssh-add2
to work.

If
.B ssh-add2
needs a passphrase, it will read the passphrase from the current
terminal if it was run from a terminal.  If
.B ssh-add2
does not have a terminal associated with it but
.SM DISPLAY\s0
is set, it
will open an X11 window to read the passphrase.  This is particularly
useful when calling
.B ssh-add2
from a .Xsession or related script.  (Note that on some machines it
may be necessary to redirect the input from /dev/null to make this work.)


.SH OPTIONS
.TP 0.5i
.B \-p
Read passphrase from stdin (or pipe).
.TP
.B \-l
Lists all identities currently represented by the agent.
.TP
.B \-N
Keys added/deleted are stored in the OpenPGP keyring and identified by key 
name string.
.TP
.B \-P
Keys added/deleted are stored in the OpenPGP keyring and identified by key 
fingerprint.
.TP
.B \-F
Keys added/deleted are stored in the OpenPGP keyring and identified by key 
id number.
.TP
.B \-d
Instead of adding the identity, removes the identity from the agent.
.TP
.B \-D
Deletes all identities from the agent.
.TP
.B \-L
Temporarily locks the agent with a password.
.TP
.B \-U
Unlocks the locked agent.
.TP
.B \-1
Agent is not allowed to use keys added with this command
in ssh1 compatibility operations.	
.TP
.B \-u
The keys added are not read from the file, but instead the key is 
given to the agent as URL.  With this functionality, agent can get
information about the additional key sources, like smartcards.
.TP
.B \-f forwarding steps
Key can be used only through as many forwarding steps as directed by
the argument.  Argument 0 states that key can only be used locally.
Be aware, that ssh1 does not submit forwarding information, so with
ssh1 compatibility, this constraint may not work as expected.
.TP
.B \-F forwarding constraint
The argument is a comma separated list, through which kind of steps
the key can be forwarded.  For example constraint string
"*.ssh.fi,rinne.iki.fi" 
states that key can be forwarded to any host in domain 
.I ssh.fi
and also to host
.I rinne.iki.fi
and used locally.
Be aware, that ssh1 does not submit forwarding information, so with
ssh1 compatibility, this constraint may not work as expected.
.TP
.B \-t timeout
The agent is advised to delete the key after timeout.  Timeout is
given in minutes.
.TP
.B \-R OpenPGP keyring
Argument identifies OpenPGP secret keyring file.

.SH RETURN STATUS

.B ssh-add2
returns one of the following exit statuses.  These may be useful in scripts.
.IP 0
The requested operation was performed successfully.
.IP 1
No connection could be made to the authentication agent.  Presumably
there is no authentication agent active in the execution environment
of
.B ssh-add2.
.IP 2
The user did not supply a required passphrase.
.IP 3
An identify file could not be found, was not readable, or was in
bad format.
.IP 4
The agent does not have the requested identity.
.IP 5
An unspecified error has occurred; this is a catch-all for errors not
listed above.
.RT
