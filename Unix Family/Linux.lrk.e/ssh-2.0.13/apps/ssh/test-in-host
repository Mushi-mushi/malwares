# This script, when given a distribution name as an argument and run
# in the "apps/ssh" directory in a compiled CVS tree, copies sources to the
# machine given as a second argument, compiles the software there, and
# performs basic testing.  Output is printed on standard output and in
# a temporary file that will then be analyzed automatically.  A
# summary will be printed in standard error.
#
# It is recommended that login be allowed to the test machine without
# having to type passwords (otherwise they need to be typed several
# times while this script is executing).
#
# It is assumed that working scp, ssh, etc. can be found in PATH.
