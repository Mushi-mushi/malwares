				zlib support by plaguez	


	ADMsniff is a libpcap-based sniffer, designed to be
	portable and powerful.

	
Installation:
	- edit the makefile,
	- run make
	(btw I'm too lazy to include zlibc in this distro so you'll
	have to build zlibc yourself.)

Notes about logs compression:
	- To enable log file compress, edit the Makefile and uncomment
	the appropriate line. You must have zlib installed.
	- For compression purposes, the log file is not flushed when
	compression is enabled. To flush it at any time, send a HUP
	signal to ADMsniff. To quit the sniffer and cleanly close the
	logfile, send the TERM signal.
