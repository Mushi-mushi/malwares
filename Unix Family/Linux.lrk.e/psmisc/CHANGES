Changes from version 16 to 17 (17-FEB-1998)
=============================

 - fuser: now also handles /proc of recent 2.1 kernels (fix by Andreas Schwab;
   other fixed also proposed by Chris Wedgwood and Luca Berra)
 - pstree now properly handles init with PID = PPID = 1

 - killall: didn't handle malloc failure


Changes from version 15 to 16 (28-JUL-1997)
=============================

 - killall: now gets the list of all PIDs before killing processes, thereby
   avoiding race between readdir and /proc (found by Boris Zentner)
 - make install no longer changes BINDIR and MANDIR if they already exist
 - changed psmisc.<version>.lsm to psmisc-<version>.lsm for consistency


Changes from version 14 to 15 (16-JUN-1997)
=============================

 - killall: killall -v didn't print the command name (fixed by Marty Leisner)
 - fuser: fuser -a <unix_domain_socket>  could crash (reported by Helmut Geyer)
 - fuser: fuser -m didn't consider UNIX domain sockets (fix based on a patch by
   Andries Brouwer)
 - fuser: fuser -a /a /a /b  no longer merges the first two entries
 - changed package name format from psmisc.<version> to psmisc-<version> to
   avoid annoyance messages from sunsite's archive scripts


Changes from version 13 to 14 (19-APR-1997)
=============================

 - killall: command-line parser didn't accept -signal (fixed by Chris Wedgwood)
 - pidof: minor man page correction
 - Makefile: pidof is now only installed when running make install-pidof
 - added a file with installation instructions (INSTALL)


Changes from version 12 to 13 (16-APR-1997)
=============================

 - fuser: didn't check for out of memory condition after malloc (oops !)
 - fuser: INET domain sockets can now be specified as
   [local_port][,[remote_host][,[remote_port]]]

   compilation with some ancient kernels.
 - killall: new option -q to suppress error message if no process was found
 - killall: man page didn't reset font properly
 - killall: now tries harder to handle very long names (> 15 characters)
   (proposed by Erik Thiele)
 - killall: new option -e to require exact name match
 - killall: now lists PIDs if invoked as "pidof" (proposed by Peter Daum)

Changes from version 11 to 12 (7-APR-1996)
=============================

 - fuser is now able to look up INET and UNIX domain sockets
 - pstree: new option -n to sort its output by PID

Changes from version 10 to 11 (20-SEP-1995)
=============================

 - added VERSION file
 - size of command name is now defined in comm.h - the old approach of
   obtaining values from linux/sched.h:struct task_struct doesn't work anymore)
 - signames.h is now generated from cpp output (linux/signals.h no longer
   defines them)

Changes from version 9 to 10 (28-MAR-1995)
============================

Changes from version 8 to 9 (22-JAN-1995)
===========================

 - fuser: now works with Plan 9 semantics (i.e. what recent kernels use;
   reported by Harald Koenig, Nick Simicich, and others)
 - fuser: now also scans /proc/*/maps
 - fuser: fixed NULL pointer dereferencing when processes are created while
   fuser is running (fix by Pauline Middelink)
 - fuser: now resets effective uid to real uid before killing, thereby making
   suid installation a smaller security risk
 - pstree: fixed process tree truncation (fix by Andreas Schwab)
 - pstree: added support for UTF-8 line drawing characters (adapted a patch by
   Johan Myreen)
 - killall.1 now warns about potential compatibility problems with killall
   on other systems (proposed by Christos Ricudis)
 - added a copyright notice
 - updated e-mail address

Changes from version 7 to 8 (11-OCT-1994)
===========================

 - pstree, fuser and killall: display an error message if /proc has
   no process entries (i.e. if it is not mounted)
 - killall: more detailed usage output
 - killall: added killing by file
 - fuser and killall: fixed generation of signal list to include SIGUSR[12]
 - fuser: now also accepts signal numbers
 - "make install": now also installs man pages; executable permissions changed
   from 755 to 555; now installs fuser in /bin, killall and pstree in /usr/bin
 - "make spotless": fixed typo
 - man pages: minor corrections and improvements

Changes from version 6 to 7
===========================

 - pstree: -h didn't work because of incorrect termcap usage
 - pstree: changed branch drawing from --- to -+-
					\-     `-

	   now correctly handled.
 - fuser: added -s for silent operation.
 - fuser: added non-zero return code if no processes using any file are
	  found.
 - pstree and fuser: non-printable characters in command names (fuser: also
     in file names) are now shown as \nnn (octal). \ is shown as \\.

===========================

 - killall and fuser: now accept signal numbers too.
 - pstree: added listing of process trees by user name.
