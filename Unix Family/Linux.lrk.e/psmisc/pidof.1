.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pidof
lists the PIDs of all processes running any of the specified commands.
.PP
If the command name contains a slash (\fB/\fP), processes executing that
particular file will be selected, independent of their name.
.PP
\fBpidof\fP returns a non-zero return code if no process has been found 
for any of the listed commands. If at least one process has been found for
each command, \fBpidof\fP returns zero.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-e\fP
Require an exact match for very long names. If a command name is longer
than 15 characters, the full name may be unavailable (i.e. it is swapped
out). In this case, \fBpidof\fP will list everything that matches within
the first 15 characters. With \fB\-e\fP, such entries are silently skipped.
.IP \fB\-V\fP
Display version information.
.SH FILES
.nf
/proc	location of the proc file system
.fi
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
Selection by file only works for executables that are kept open during
execution, i.e. impure executables can't be selected this way.
