How-To Use the Bash door.

To get root privileges back you need two files to exist.

These files act like a password.

/tmp/mcliZokhb - if Exist then :
/tmp/mclzaKmfa - program to be set +s

What we do here is make a file "touch" called /tmp/mcliZokhb
and either copy /bin/sh to /tmp/mclzaKmfa, or use Trogan to make
a secure password protected shell. 

Bash will set /tmp/mclzaKmfa suid when /tmp/mcliZokhb exists.
If /tmp/mcliZokhb doesnt exist then bash will do nothing.

WARNING: It is very unsafe to leave a suid shell in /tmp, where
any user can run it! So use the one supplied with Trogan called
SeCshell.

This backdoor has one flaw. The backdoor will only work when a user 
with uid/gid 0(root) logs in.
