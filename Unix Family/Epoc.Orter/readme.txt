     Epoc.Orter v1.0a

From what I know of this is the first virus developed for epoc systems. This code may be buggy as I haven't tested it because I only have one epoc device and it spreads through Infrared. When run, it deletes the PC-cillin anti-virus contents and folder, copies itself to C:\System\orter and then tries to send itself through the infrared port.

I'm still working of this program, so please send your comments to me.
