			    Version 1.22

    by Mixter - http://mixter.void.ru / http://mixter.warrior2k.com


Changes:

1.22	Added fast lm_addr/lm_ntoa interfaces, ntoa is now obsolete.
        Added lm_scan_run callback function for easy creation of
        scanners and similar tools. (See manpage).

1.20	Added lmtcp2, tcp header with single flags (non-BSDish).
	Updated manual page with descriptions and structures.
	Added exclude database function, to add and match classless
	ranges of IP addresses (for network scanners, access control, etc.).

1.11    The library can now be compiled as BOTH C and C++ library.
        Structures ip/icmp/tcp/udp renamed to lmip/lmicmp/lmtcp/lmudp
        and protocol defines like IP to P_IP for compatibility reasons.
        Serious AES key setting bug fixed. Encryption now works.. 101% reliably.

1.10	Lots of bugfixes. The AES encryption should now work 100% reliably.
        Re-added compiling and installation of libmix.a, for static linking.
	Added sexec() function for active process name cloaking.

1.09	Ethernet header and functions added.
        Added a function to determine your local IP address.

1.08    A few bugs and conversion problems fixed. Library ported to C++.
        Changed library format to shared object file (.so).
        Added nstrdup() command, sighandler() is a macro now.
        Note: because of the shared library format, you now have to do
        make install before you can run libtest.

1.07	Old bugs fixed. New bugs added(?). See manpage for more.

   To compile LibMix, run './configure --with-libraries-as-cpp' and type 'make'.
   LibMix currently supports Linux, all BSD flavors, and SunOS/Solaris.
   All functions are portable, except strscpy, tfnread and tfntransmit,
   which only work reliably on Linux, as of version 1.05.

   Check the Makefile to see that the INSTALL_* directories are
   adequate for your machine, then type 'make install'.
   /usr/include and /usr/lib are the recommended locations.

   If you install the include files in a non-system include directory,
   you must specify the option -Idirectoryname when linking with LibMix.
   If you install the library in a non-system library directory,
   you must specify the option -Ldirectoryname when linking with LibMix.

   Writing programs with LibMix:
   To use LibMix functions, you need to include <mix/mix.h> in your source.
   Since LibMix is an ar archive library, not a shared object library,
   you must do the linking of your programs this way:
   gcc -c file.c -o file.o	;# Compile object files first.
   gcc file.o -lmix -o file	;# Put the -l flag after the object filename.

   Finally, you should really run the program "libtest" with all 3 tests,
   to ensure that all functions work reliably on your system and architecture.

   If you find any errors, or have (useful! =P) suggestions for bug fixes or
   whatever, drop me a mail at mixter@newyorkoffice.com or mixter@2xs.co.il.

   Have fun
