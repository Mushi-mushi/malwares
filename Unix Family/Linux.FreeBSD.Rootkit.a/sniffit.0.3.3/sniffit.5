.SH NAME
sniffit \- configuration file for sniffit (name arbirtary)

.SH DESCRIPTION
This page describes the format for the config file for 
.B sniffit 
(see
.BR sniffit (8)
). This file allows you to specify in great detail witch packets should 
be processed by 
.B sniffit.  
This file also controls (or will control) some functions for the 
continuous logging ('-L' option).
.LP
A 
.B sniffit 
config file might look like:
.IP
.nf
# Sniffit V.0.3.1 Sample Config file -- Brecht Claerhout

logfile /var/adm/sniffit.today.log

# First select all packets!
select both mhosts 1
select both mhosts 2

# Now deselect all packets from/to those damn 'surfers'
deselect both port 80             
deselect both port 8001             
.fi
.LP
This file will tell 
.B sniffit 
to process all packets on the subnet except those FROM/TO ports 80 and 
8001 (thus we don't want logs of those mass WWW connections witch turn 
our logs unreadable).

.SH "GLOBAL FORMAT"
The file consists of lines, lines are formed by fields, fields are 
separated with SPACES (NO TABS). 
Unix comment lines (starting with '#' are allowed).
So this gives us:
.IP 
<field1> <field2> <field3> <field4> <field5>

.SH "FIELD FORMAT"
.IP "<field1>"
.B select
- 
.B Sniffit 
will look for packets that match the following description 
(other fields)
.IP
.B deselect
- 
.B Sniffit 
will ignore packets that match the description
.IP
.B logfile
- change the logfile name to <field2> instead of the default 'sniffit.log'

.IP "<field2>"
.B from
- Packets FROM the host matching the following desc. are considered.
.IP
.B to
- similar, Packets TO the....
.IP 
.B both
- similar, Packets FROM or TO the....                      
.IP
.B "a filename"
- as an argument of 'logfile' in <field1>      

.IP "<field3>"
.B host
- The (de)selection criteria involves a hostname.
.IP
.B port
- similar, ... a portnumber
.IP
.B mhosts
- The (de)selection criteria involves multiple-hosts, like with the 
wildcars in 0.3.0, but without the 'x'

.IP "<field4>"
Either a hostname, a portnumber or a numbet-dot partial notatiion 
indicating multiple hosts depending on <field3>

.IP "<field5>"
A portnumber, if <field3> was 'host' or 'mhosts' (optional, if not filled 
in, all ports are going to be (de)selected)

.SH "FILE INTERPRETING"
The config file is interpreted SEQUENTIAL, so watch it, don't mix lines 
in a file. Example:
.IP
.nf
      select both mhosts 100.100.12.
      deselect both port 80
      select both host 100.100.12.2

This file will get you the packets:
      a) Send by hosts '100.100.12.*'
      b) EXCEPT the WWW packets
      c) BUT showing the WWW packets concerning 
         100.100.12.2
.fi
.IP
.nf
      select both mhosts 100.100.12.
      select both host 100.100.12.2
      deselect both port 80      

Will give you the packets (probably unwanted result):
      a) Send by hosts '100.100.12.*'
      b) Send from/to 100.100.12.2 (useless line)
      c) deselecting all WWW packets on the subnet
