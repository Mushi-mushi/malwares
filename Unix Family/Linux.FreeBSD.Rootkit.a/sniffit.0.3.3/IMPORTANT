Here are some remarks that could be important for some ppl. It gives 
extra info on various systems and fixes needed on some systems.

The files referred to in here can be found in the 'Misc' directory.
Most of those things are contributed by other ppl, so I don't take 
resposability for this. 

1) configure: libpcap/configure script for bash/zsh type of shells.   
              Contributed by Qing Long

2) ncurses: When having problems with ncurses during Sniffit compilation, 
            please check the paths, and add some symbolic links. ncurses 
            installations tend to differ.

3) FREEBSD: You should apply the FreeBSD_patch as follwing
                'patch ../libpcap/pcap.c <FreeBSD_patch'
            (when in Misc dir) It is a dirty patch (but it works)
            After that, do a:
                'make freebsd' 
            NOT 'make all' or 'make sniffit'

4) SunOS/SOLARIS: have a look at detect_system if it doesn't compile at first
                  you'll have to change a line (the info is in the file).
