In future (I hope):
 - VFS, ya, no more lame syscall handling, abuse VFS directly
 - some crontab-like thing :)
 - packet sniffer to snarf whole net segment
 - protect binary against simple kinds of string pattern analysis
   like `grep` or `strings`
 - some stealth against /dev/pty, /dev/pts owned by
   backdoor terminal ... It looks a bit suspicious when
   owner is root but fuser have no clue who uses them :)
 - handle int 0x80 by redirecting whole IDT table to
   the new one, with our int 0x80, just when I will
   get idea why that damned lidt doesn't work ;(


Prove/fix these:
 - better sniffer
 - *really* lame crypto
 - lame tty client (ya, needs more, do it for yourself :P)
 - find out/fix *why* suckit can't work twice on one box (the 'll
   second segv kernel)
 - dummy/lame makefiles
 - buy more hashish XD
 - condition of `cp -f /root/some/backup /sbin/init` better when
   stealthing enabled
