This is a simple FreeBSD kernel module, result of the period of time when I
was analizing the source code of FreeBSD kernel. This module isn't final product - 
I wrote, it is  only for showing what we can do with system using kernel modules. 
It contains small hacks and simple solutions, which someone can classify as a
"rootkit" functions. Why not? Every API-function or shell-command can be
used for cracking the system and my rootkit also can be used this way....

So... now we have:
1)Functions which can hide any process and it's children from the system.
2)Functions which can Hide any files from the system.
3)Functions for manipulations with uids, euids etc.
4)Small TCP/IP stack modifications for the purpose of hiding active connections.

I have tested module on FreeBSD 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. I think it SHOULD work in 
all 4.x family.

Good luck :-)
