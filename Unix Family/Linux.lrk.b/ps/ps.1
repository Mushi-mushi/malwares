.SH NAME
ps \- report process status
.SH SYNOPSIS
ps [\fB\-\fR][\fBlujsvmaxScewhrnu\fR][\fBt\fIxx\fR]\
[\fBO\fR[\fB+\fR|\fB-\fR]\fIk1\fR[[\fB+\fR|\fB-\fR]\fIk2\fR...]]\
[\fIpids\fR]

there are also two long options:

.BR \-\-sort\fIX [ + | - ] \fIkey [,[ + | - ] \fIkey [, ... ]]

.B "\-\-help"

More long options are on the way...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B "ps "
gives a snapshot of the current processes.  If you want a repetitive
update of this status, use
.BR top .
This man page documents the
.BR /proc -based
version of
.BR ps ,
or tries to.
.PP
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"
Command line arguments may optionally be preceeded by a '\-', but
there is no need for it.  There are also some "long options" in GNU style;
see below for those.
.TP 0.5i
.B "l "
long format
.TP 0.5i
.B "u "
user format: gives user name and start time
.TP 0.5i
.B "j "
jobs format: pgid sid
.TP 0.5i
.B "s"
signal format
.TP 0.5i
.B "v "
vm format
.TP 0.5i
.B "m "
displays memory info (combine with
.B p
flag to get number of pages).
.TP 0.5i
.B "f "
"forest" family tree format for command line
.TP 0.5i
.B "a "
show processes of other users too
.TP 0.5i
.B "x "
show processes without controlling terminal
.TP 0.5i
.B "S "
add child cpu time and page faults
.TP 0.5i
.B "c "
command name from task_struct
.TP 0.5i
.B "e "
show environment after command line and ` + '
.TP 0.5i
.B "w "
wide output: don't truncate command lines to fit on one line.
.TP 0.5i
.B "h "
no header
.TP 0.5i
.B "r "
running procs only
.TP 0.5i
.B "n "
numeric output for
.B USER and
.BR WCHAN .
.TP 0.5i
.BI t xx
only procs with controlling tty
.IR xx ;
use for
.I xx
the same letters as shown in the
.B TT
field.  The tty name must be given immediately after the option,
with no intervening space, e.g.
.BR "ps -tv1" .
.TP 0.5i
.BR O [ + | - ] \fIk1 [,[ + | - ] \fIk2 [, ... ]]
Order the process listing according to the multi-level sort specified by
the sequence of \fIshort\fR keys from \fBSORT KEYS\fR, \fIk1\fR, \fIk2\fR, ...
Default order specifications exist for each of the various formats of \fBps\fR.
These are over-ridden by a user specified ordering.  The `+' is quite optional,
merely re-iterating the default direction on a key.  `-' reverses direction only
on the key it precedes.  As with \fBt\fR and \fIpids\fR, the O option must be
the last option in a single command argument, but specifications in successive
arguments are catenated.
.TP 0.5i
.I pids
List only the specified processes; they are comma-delimited.  The 
list must be given immediately after the last option in a single command-line
argument, with no intervening space, e.g.
.BR "ps -j1,4,5" .
Lists specified in subsequent arguments are catenated, e.g.
.B ps -l 1,2 3,4 5 6
will list all of the processes 1-6 in long format.
.SH "LONG COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"
These options are preceeded by a double\-hyphen.
.TP 0.5i
.BR \-\-sort\fIX [ + | - ] \fIkey [,[ + | - ] \fIkey [, ... ]]
Choose a \fImulti-letter key\fR from the \fBSORT KEYS\fR section. \fIX\fR may be
any convenient separator character.  To be GNU-ish use `='.  The `+' is really
optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.
E.g.:
.B ps -jax --sort=uid,-ppid,+pid
.TP 0.5i
.B "\-\-help"
Get a help message that summarizes the usage and gives a list of
supported sort keys.  This list may be more up to date than this man
page.
.SH "SORT KEYS"
Note that the values used in sorting are the internal values \fBps\fR uses and
\fInot\fR the `cooked' values used in some of the output format fields.  If
someone wants to volunteer to write special comparison functions for the cooked
values, ... ;-)

.SH "FIELD DESCRIPTIONS"
.TP 0.5i
.B "PRI "
This is the counter field in the task struct.  It is the time in
.B HZ
of the process's possible timeslice.
.TP 0.5i
.B "NI "
Standard unix nice value; a positive value means less cpu time.
.TP 0.5i
.B "SIZE "
Virtual image size; size of text+data+stack.
.TP 0.5i
.B "RSS "
Resident set size; kilobytes of program in memory.
.TP 0.5i
.B "WCHAN "
Name of the kernel function where the process is sleeping, with the
.RB ` sys_ '
stripped from the function name.  If
.B /etc/psdatabase
does not exist, it is just a hex number instead.
.TP 0.5i
.B "STAT "
Information about the status of the process.  The first field is
.B R
for runnable,
.B S
for sleeping,
.B D
for uninterruptible sleep,
.B T
for stopped or traced, or
.B Z
for a zombie process.  The second field contains
.B W
if the process has no resident pages.  The third field is
.B N
if the process has a positive nice value
.RB ( NI
field).
.TP 0.5i
.B "TT "
Controlling tty.
.TP 0.5i
.B "PAGEIN "
Number of major page faults (page faults that cause pages to be read
from disk, including pages read from the buffer cache).
.TP 0.5i
.B "TRS "
Text resident size.
.TP 0.5i
.B "SWAP "
Kilobytes (or pages if
.B \-p
is used) on swap device.
.TP 0.5i
.B "SHARE "
Shared memory.
.SH UPDATING
This
.BR proc -based
.B ps
works by reading the files in the
.B proc
filesystem, mounted on
.BR /proc .
This
.B ps
does not need to be suid
.B kmem
or have any privileges to run.
.I "Do not give this ps any special permissions."
.PP
You will need to update the
.B /etc/psdatabase
file by running
.B /etc/psupdate
to get meaningful information from the
.B WCHAN
field.  This should be done every time you compile a new kernel.
.PP
.SH NOTES
The member
.B used_math
of
.B task_struct
is not shown, since
.B crt0.s
checks to see if math is present.  This causes the math flag to be set
for all processes, and so it is worthless.
.PP
Programs swapped out to disk will be shown without command line
arguments, and unless the
.B c
option is given, in parentheses.
.PP
.B %CPU
shows the cputime/realtime percentage.  It will not add up to 100%
unless you are lucky.  It is time used divided by the time the process
has been running.
.PP
The
.B SIZE
and
.B RSS
fields don't count the page tables and the
.B task_struct
of a proc; this is at least 12k of memory that is always resident.
.B SIZE
is the virtual size of the proc (code+data+stack).
.PP
.SH BUGS
Tty names are hard coded: virtual consoles are v1, v2, ...  serial
lines are s0 and s1, pty's are pp0, pp1 ..., pq0, pq1, ....
.SH AUTHOR
.B ps
was originally written by Branko Lankester (lankeste@fwi.uva.nl)
Michael K. Johnson (johnsonm@sunsite.unc.edu) re-wrote it significantly to
use the proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.  Michael
Shields (mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu) added the multiple-pids feature.  Charles
Blake(cblake@ucsd.edu) added multi-level sorting and is the current maintainer
of the proc-ps suite.
