* Use the output from "uname -s" to auto-select the target in the Makefile.

* Write more ./READMEs/README.* files

* Implement more test programs in ./testdir

* Long and short command options.

* Implement a config file (/etc/identd.conf).

* Implement some way for an external program to register indirect
  pointers. For example a TCP/IP relaying daemon might wanna do this.
  So that the <Identifier> returned will look something like:

      42 , 4711 : USERID : OTHER : foo (fubar.su!bar)

  or:

      42 , 4711 : USERID : OTHER : foo (this.host.se!foo (fubar.su!bar))

  Probably should be implemented using a UNIX domain socket with access
  control.

* Implement some way to encrypt <Identifiers>.
