			4.1beta		2.5.2		<timw@sequent.com>

Build comments:		Nothing unusual

Install comments:	Generally install into /usr/etc

Usage comments:		Tested running under inetd. This will *not* work
			unless you have ptx TCP/IP v2.4.0 or later. This
			was the first version where inetd will (optionally)
			pass a socket instead of a TLI endpoint.
			Has been tested in standalone mode.
			It has also not been tested under ptx 4.0.X.
			It may be necessary to change ptx4.c to open /dev/mem
			instead of /dev/kmem for this release.
