Q: Pidentd stopped working for some reason - help!

A: Always as a first step get the latest version of Pidentd from:

	ftp.lysator.liu.se:pub/ident/servers

   and install that one.



Q: I just upgraded to Solaris 2.x from Solaris 2.(x-1), now Pidentd
   doesn't work anymore - why?

A1: You did recompile Pidentd _on_ a machine running the new OS did you?

A2: If you used Gcc to compile it: You did recompile and install a new
    version of Gcc configured for the new OS version, didn't you?
    (Gcc builds fixed include files which are used instead of the
    system ones - and they are _not_ portable between OS releases).



Q: I just compiled it on Solaris 2.4 - and it doesn't work. All I
	get is "NO-USER".

A: Make sure you have only installed _one_ of the patches:

		102049-04	 (I recommend this one)
		102303-05

   You can't have both installed at the same time.


Q: I'm running AIX 4.2 and Pidentd doesn't work. Help!

A: Check out the READMEs/README.aix!
