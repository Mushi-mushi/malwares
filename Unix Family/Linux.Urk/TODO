Cloaking will be added shortly.
	This will involve redirection of the target's display.
	for use with sum/md5/ls/others...
	eg.
	ls -l /bin/ls will translate into ls -la /usr/man/man1/xxxxxx/ls
	and the output will be for the original ls.
	also if there is an attempt to overwrite the filter, it will be
	redirected to the real binary.  This will help emiminate the problems
	assosiated with replacing system binaries.

More local filters/redirection.

Library trojuns.
	Cross platform lib's are also planned that will be able to filter
	requests from programs making syscalls.
Kernel Trojuns...
