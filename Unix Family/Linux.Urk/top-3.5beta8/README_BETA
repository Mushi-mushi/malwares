BETA TESTING NOTES

DEADLINE FOR COMMENTS: Friday June 5.  At that point this will be
turned in to release 3.5.

This is a beta release of top version 3.5.  Please return your
comments to wnl@groupsys.com as soon as possible.

Some have complained that top will not compile under IRIX 6.4 (or, one
user reported, 6.3).  Not having access to IRIX, I need someone to
investigate what it would take to retrofit irix62.c to make it work
under 6.4.

I moved the definition of _KMEMUSER in m_sunos5.c.  This makes top
compile cleanly under Solaris 2.6 with gcc without needing to apply
the gcc patch.  I can't determine for certain if this affects
compilation under any of the earlier revisions of SunOS 5.x.

Module sunos5 should work for SunOS 5.7beta, thanks to Casper.

Module sunos5 has changed the way it presents priority values.  It now
matches what ps says.

This release contains a "Year 2000" statement.  It's the only one I've
ever written.  Comments welcome.
