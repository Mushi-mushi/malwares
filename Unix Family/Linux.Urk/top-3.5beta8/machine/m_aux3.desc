SYNOPSIS:  a Mac running A/UX version 3.x

DESCRIPTION:
This is the machine-dependent module for A/UX 3.x.

Although AUX does not generally have a renice systemcall, it can be
implemented by tweeking kernel memory.  While such a simple hack should
not be difficult to get right, USE THIS FEATURE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
To turn on setpriority emulation, add "-DIMPLEMENT_SETPRIORITY" to
the CFLAGS when prompted in the configure script.

CFLAGS: -Dclear=clear_scr -DPRIO_PROCESS=0
