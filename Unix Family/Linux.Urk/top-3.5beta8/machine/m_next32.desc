NEXTSTEP v.0.3  2/14/1996 tpugh

SYNOPSIS:  any m68k or intel NEXTSTEP v3.x system

DESCRIPTION:
	This is the machine-dependent module for NEXTSTEP v3.x
	Reported to work for NEXTSTEP v3.0, v3.2, and v3.3 Mach OS:
		NEXTSTEP v3.0 on Motorola machines.
		NEXTSTEP v3.2 on Intel and Motorola machines.
		NEXTSTEP v3.3 on Intel and Motorola machines.
	Problem with command column for (Choose next40 for fix):
		NEXTSTEP v3.2 on HP machines.
		NEXTSTEP v3.3 on HP and Sparc machines.
	Has not been tested for NEXTSTEP v2.x machines, although it should work.
	Has not been tested for NEXTSTEP v3.1 machines, although it should work.
	Install "top" with the permissions 4755.
		hostname# chmod 4755 top
		hostname# ls -lg top
		-rwsr-xr-x  1 root     kmem      121408 Sep  1 10:14 top*
	With the kmem group sticky bit set, we can read kernal memory without problems,
	but to communicate with the Mach kernal for task and thread info, it requires
	root privileges. Therefore, "top" must be setuid 4755 with the owner as root.

LIBS: 

Need the compiler flag, "-DSHOW_UTT", to see the user task and thread task
data structures to report process info.

CFLAGS: -DSHOW_UTT
