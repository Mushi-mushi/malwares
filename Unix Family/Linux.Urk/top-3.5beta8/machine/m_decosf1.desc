top - a top users display for Unix

SYNOPSIS:  DEC Alpha AXP running OSF/1 or Digital Unix 4.0.

DESCRIPTION:
This is the machine-dependent module for DEC OSF/1 
It is known to work on OSF/1 1.2, 1.3, 2.0-T3, 3.0, and Digital Unix V4.0
WARNING: if you use optimization with the standard "cc" compiler that
.        comes with V3.0 the resulting executable may core dump.  If
.        this happens, recompile without optimization.

LIBS: -lmld -lmach

CFLAGS: -DHAVE_GETOPT

AUTHOR:  Anthony Baxter, <anthony@aaii.oz.au>
Derived originally from m_ultrix, by David S. Comay <dsc@seismo.css.gov>, 
although by now there is hardly any of the code from m_ultrix left.
Helped a lot by having the source for syd(1), by Claus Kalle, and
from several people at DEC who helped with providing information on
some of the less-documented bits of the kernel interface.

Modified: 31-Oct-94, Pat Welch, tpw@physics.orst.edu
	changed _mpid to pidtab for compatibility with OSF/1 version 3.0

Modified: 13-Dec-94, William LeFebvre, lefebvre@dis.anl.gov
	removed used of pidtab (that was bogus) and changed things to
	automatically detect the absence of _mpid in the nlist and
	recover gracefully---this appears to be the only difference
	with 3.0.

Theres some real icky bits in this code - you have been warned :)
Extremely icky bits are marked with FIXME: 

Theory of operation: 

Use Mach calls to build up a structure that contains all the sorts
of stuff normally found in a struct proc in a BSD system. Then
everything else uses this structure. This has major performance wins,
and also should work for future versions of the O/S.
