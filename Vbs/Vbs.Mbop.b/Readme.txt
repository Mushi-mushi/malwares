Mbop!.b:
	This new version has all the features of the Mbop!.a (you can
	see them in the "Readme.Mbop!.a.txt" file), but i have added 
	new features:
	1: It searchs for the "Private sub Document_open()" on the
	receiver codemodule, and if it find him, the macro delete
	from that line, to the first "end sub"). This feature is
	for deleting any other virus that was before in the infected
	document, cause any other way you'll get an error message if
	ther are 2 "Document_open()" subs.
	2. This one does the same that the first one, but it search for
	"option explicit", and delete that line, cause i haven't
	declare any variable, and i don't want to get an eror.

Hey!, if you wanna get the sorce code read the "Mbop!.b.Source.txt"
      file.
      If you wanna get a better explanation of all the features, read
      the "Readme.Mbop!.a.txt" file, there is a good explanation there.

      The next version will have, outlook replication, and maybe, mirc
      relication too.

      At this time, the Mbop!.a Macro virus haven't been added by any
      av, and i help it keeps like this, but if they can find my virus
      i will modify the Poly engine till i made a undetectable one,
      that is a really hard thin, but, i'm trying!.
