<P>This is a second reminder to log in to PayPal as soon as possible. Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to restore your account access.</P>
<P>Be sure to log in securely by opening a new browser window and typing the PayPal URL. Once you log in, you will be provided with steps to restore your<BR>account access. We appreciate your understanding as we work to ensure account safety.</P>
<P>In accordance with PayPal's User Agreement, your account access will remain limited until the issue has been resolved. Unfortunately, if access to your<BR>account remains limited for an extended period of time, it may result in further limitations or eventual account closure. We encourage you to log in to<BR>your PayPal account as soon as possible to help avoid this.</P>
