procedures, we have detected a slight error in your billing information.</p>
<p>This might be due to either of the following reasons:</p>

of address).<br>
<strong>2.</strong> Submiting invalid information during the initial sign up 
process.<br>
<strong>3.</strong> An inability to accurately verify your selected option of 
payment due to an internal error within our processors.</p>
<p>Go to your account page and verify your informations: </p>
