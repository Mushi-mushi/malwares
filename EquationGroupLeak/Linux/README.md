On April 4, 2017 a blog post was [published](https://medium.com/@shadowbrokerss/dont-forget-your-base-867d304a94b1) by the Shadow Brokers group revealing the password for the `eqgrp-auction-file.tar.xz.gpg` file (`CrDj"(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#>deB7mN`). The contents of this directory include the contents of that file; in the original version, a number of compressed files were included, all of those files have been extracted here to simplify browsering and file discovery.

This is made available for researchers and security professionals to easily find and browse these files.
