cp /mnt/zip/<file>.bin /current/bin/FW/Tools/thttpd/httptmp/

# Remove the execute bit, else the http server thinks it's a broken cgi script.
chmod -x /current/bin/FW/Tools/thttpd/httptmp/*

# Start the server

/current/bin/FW/Tools/thttpd/thttpd -p 8000 -d /current/bin/FW/Tools/thttpd/httptmp -l /current/bin/FW/Tools/thttpd/http.log
