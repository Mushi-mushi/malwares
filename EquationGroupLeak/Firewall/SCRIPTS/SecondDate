## Make sure you brought your inject file to the OP
## If there is a custom regular expression file, bring that too


1. Upload seconddate module (pix631 or higher)

2. Activate module

3. Exit BG

4. Run the secondDate binary

./SecondDateLP 127.0.0.1 [UDP port]

You can use the same UDP tunnel that you had up for BG

5. At the secondDate prompt type: ping

6. If it says OK., Then proceed.  If not try again or maybe remake the tunnels.  If it 
keeps timing out, wait the entire timeout period before trying again (usually 5 mins)

7. After it says OK, you can type help for a full list of items

8. Making a rule, type rule <enter>

9. Enter a number you want to modify/edit <enter>

10.  Fill in all information that is required

11. If you are injecting, say 'y' to that question

12. For min injection time, put up to 300 seconds (this will all depend on pix load)

13. Max injection, 5 is okay, just whatever the load will be

14. On injection window, if you leave it at 0, it will inject until you shut it down.
If you set a time, it will inject for that time period and then shutdown.

15. If you need to change TCP flags, you can but defaults are fine.

16. Default on HTTP GET checks are fine.

17. If you have a custom regex, do only 3 filters max.  Load could be overwhelming.

18. Provide the inject file with the tag

19. Do a 'showrule --all' to see if all is what it should be

20. Enable that rule by typing: en 1

If you need to see if the rules are working (after there is time for an inject to happen), you can
run 'getlog' 

And if you want packetcount, you can type 'getinfo'
