echo Joe and salesman -

echo Joe was moderately successful in his career, but as he got older he
echo was increasingly hampered by terrible headaches. When his personal
echo hygiene and love life started to suffer, he sought medical help.
pause
cls
echo After being referred from one specialist to another, he finally came
echo across a doctor who solved the problem.  "The good news is I can
echo cure your headaches.  The bad news is that it will require castration.
pause
cls
echo You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press
echo up against the base of your spine.
echo The pressure creates one hell of a headache. 
echo The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."
pause
cls
echo Joe was shocked and depressed.  He wondered if he had anything to
echo live for.  He couldn't concentrate long enough to answer, but
echo decided he had no choice but to go under the knife.
pause
cls
echo When he left the hospital, his mind was clear, but he felt like he
echo was missing an important part of himself.  As he walked down the
echo street, he realized that he felt like a different person.  He could
echo make a new beginning and live a new life.
pause
cls
echo He walked past a men's clothing store and thought, "That's what I
echo need, a new suit."  He entered the shop and told the salesman, "I'd
echo like a new suit."
pause
cls
echo The salesman eyed him briefly and said, "Let's see... size 44 long."
echo Joe laughed, "That's right, how did you know?"
echo "It's my job." Joe tried on the suit.  It fit perfectly.  As Joe admired himself 
echo in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?"
pause
cls
echo Joe thought for a moment and then said, "Sure!"
echo The salesman eyed Joe and said, "Let's see,... 34 sleeve and... 16 and a half neck."
echo Joe was surprised, "That's right, how did you know?"
pause
cls
echo  "It's my job."
echo Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.  As Joe adjusted the
echo collar in the mirror, the salesman asked, "How about new shoes?"
echo Joe was on a roll and said, "Sure!"
pause
cls
echo The salesman eyed Joe's feet and said, "Let's see...9 and a half  wide."
echo Joe was astonished, "That's right, how did you know?"  "It's my job."
pause
cls
echo Joe tried on the shoes and they fit perfectly.
echo Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, "How about a new  hat?"
echo Without hesitating, Joe said, "Sure!"
echo The salesman eyed Joe's head and said, "Let's see. . . 7 5/8."
pause
cls
echo  Joe was incredulous, "That's right, how did you know?"
 echo "It's my job."
echo The hat fit perfectly.  Joe was feeling great, when the salesman asked, "How about some new underwear?"
echo Joe thought for a second and said, "Sure!"
pause
cls
echo The salesman stepped back, eyed Joe's waist and said, "Let's see... size 36."
echo Joe laughed, "No, I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old."
echo The salesman shook his head and said, "You can't wear a size 34 It
echo would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and
echo give you one hell of a headache!"
