echo Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree bad, and its fruit bad. 
echo For the tree is known by its fruit. Every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. . . 
echo 1. A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree produce good fruit. 
echo 2. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.! 
echo 3. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat,. 
echo 4. For in the day that you eat from it you shall surely die...
