                              - TridenT  -

This is a collection of 100+ viruses, many of them with the original source 
code.  These viruses were created by the members of the Dutch virus writing
group TridenT. The collection is divided into seperate archives to cover the 
individual members of the group:
                
                - Bit Addict
                - Crom-Cruach
                - Dark Helmet
                - Darkray
                - Masud Khafir
                - Glen Benton later known as John Tardy

Also included are the 4 versions of the TridenT Polymorphic Engine, 
one of the first polymorphic engines used to create "undetectable" viruses,
and interviews with several of the members. Spread throughout the archives
are copies of viruses of TridenT "copy-cats" and "wannabees".

Following "updates" to this collection will be minor since the "well" is
about dry. I must have waded thru 100+ Mb of files to get this far, there is
no more to find.

Enjoy
