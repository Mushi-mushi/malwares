;This is a disassembly of Thunderbyte's anti-viral partition code.
;An org statement was not used because it appears that all offsets used 
;herein are either relative or absolute, i.e. it just doesn't matter.
;This should be compiled as a binary image file, it *WILL NOT* create 
;an executable file. This code is exactly 512 bytes long and should be 
;implanted into the hard drive at physical sector 1, cylinder 0, head 0
;using the BIOS direct write to disk function. *DO NOT* use DOS write to 
;disk functions or DEBUG because these functions can't access hidden sectors
;and you'll probably just overwrite the disk drive.

;have fun, folks!
